Ironically, I didn’t quite take notes but I think the themes also feature in this short video:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKM2jE2PygY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe live session was fun because of a super engaged chat — everyone had great suggestions for managing some of these (surprisingly common?) behaviors.\n\nI’ll not share the premise (it’s self-explanatory + there’s the video), but the discussion involved three parts:\n\n1. why it’s an issue;\n\n2. why-do-we-do-this-to-ourselves;\n\n3. how do we not keep doing it 😀\n\nI’ll share a tweet-length summary of my takeaways.\n\n>Caveat I: 280 chars! Twitter isn’t the platform for nuance. 😅\n>\n>Caveat II. Should go without saying, but all of this gyaan needs to be tempered with context, which was a frequently used word throughout the session!\n\n---\n\n:::{.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n\n⚠️  Not learning from previous mistakes.\n\n🤔  False sense of accomplishment, dopamine hit from a clean slate, FOMO (new tools).\n\n💡 Start simple, iterate slowly, resist looking at shiny new objects.\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Feeling guilty\n\n⚠️  Can’t win when you are at war with yourself.\n\n🤔  Probably comes from knowing you’ll trip again.\n\n💡 Extend to yourself the same courtesy and patience you’d show to a friend, consider replacing guilt with curiosity.\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Perfectionism\n\n⚠️  Not making mistakes is a risky way to live.\n\n🤔  Feeds ego, sense of control and safety, and you think you push yourself harder with lofty standards.\n\n💡 Aim for B+, fail in public and value it — can be a relief to not have to keep up with the perfect image.\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Do *all* the research first\n\n⚠️  When overdone, really procrastination in disguise.\n\n🤔  Creates an illusion of getting work done. Paranoia associate with diving in without preparation.\n\n💡 Second brains are not for archival, but production. Iterate often. Timebox research.\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Going big\n\n⚠️  Ambition dominates the public discourse around goal-setting. Big goals are not problematic until they get in the way.\n\n🤔  Ego boosted, creates a potentially misguided sense of being inspired.\n\n💡 Break things down, take incremental (read: realistic!) steps.\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Doing it all yourself\n\n⚠️  Potentially limiting.\n\n🤔  A desire for respect or credit, and the sense that nobody can do this as well as me.\n\n💡 Delegate when appropriate, especially when looking to scale and/or diversify.\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Comparing yourself to others\n\n⚠️  Potentially depressing.\n\n🤔  Self-pity, and an excuse to not even try.\n\n💡 Compare to past you. Read your old journal entries. (Also, journal.)\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Postpone gratification\n\n⚠️  For something to be sustainable, it needs to be fun!\n\n🤔  Traditional positive quality.\n\n💡 Enjoy the journey because nobody knows the destination. Live in the moment, find joy in the small things, be present. Also, music for instant gratification!\n:::\n\n\n\nDo check out the [Second Brain Summit](https://www.secondbrainsummit.com/) for the remaining sessions.\n\nI think you get a link to a recording if you’re registered for a session, at least this was the case for me with the opening session.\n\nThe community attending this is also [on a slack](https://basb.io/slack)."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../css/styles.css"],"toc":true,"html-math-method":"katex","include-after-body":["../../footer.html"],"filters":["abstract-section"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","theme":["simplex","../../custom.scss"],"js":"../../scripts.js","smooth-scroll":true,"anchor-sections":true,"page-layout":"full","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Eight Self-Sabotaging Behaviors","date":"2022-03-15","categories":["funda","twitterthread"],"fields":["date","title"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
