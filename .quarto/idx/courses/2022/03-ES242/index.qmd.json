It’s important to do this nicely based on what you want to do with the information.\n\nFor example, the notes you might be taking in this class is information. If you have no plans of revisiting them later, you can take them as you please, or better yet, not take them at all!\n\nHowever, you want your notes optimised for giving you quality company during a 2AM revision session on exam day, competing with Maggi for attention, you want your notes to be competently taken: they don’t have to be neat, and it’s enough for them to be useful.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are taking notes so that a special someone who will inevitably miss a few classes will almost certainly ask for later, then you would be making notes to impress, and that potentially requires a different approach.\n\nThroughout this course, we will try to make sense of trade-offs.\n\n> ##### Topics\n> sequential data (arrays, dynamic arrays, linked lists and variants) • dequeues, stacks, queues • graph representations • graph traversals (BFS/DFS) and applications (connected components, bipartiteness, topological sort) • searching and sorting • heaps • BSTs • (2,3)-trees\n:::\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n##### Target Audience\nThis course is aimed at undergraduates in their first or second year, as a first introduction to data structures and algorithms.\n\n:::\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n##### Prerequisites\nThe course is largely self-contained.
