The use of visual communication through art and illustrations, video, audio-visual content and more, has been noted to have a wider reach and breach new barriers. \n\nThrough this two-day course, students will engage with science communication through images. They will be introduced to some fundamentals of visual science communication, understand how to tell stories using images, learn to tailor their content to different target audiences, and gain perspectives on how different visual language can impact science communication. \n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n# About the Instructor\nIpsa Jain is a scientist turned illustrator, who uses the visual medium to tell tales of science.
