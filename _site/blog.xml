  <title>13 Sheep</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/13sheep/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://www.moritzdressler.de/en/13_Sheep">13 Sheep</a> happens to be a cute roll-and-write game designed by Moritz Dressler that involves protecting a bunch of sheep on a grid by placing small fences that have pre-defined shapes.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/13sheep/13sheep.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="420"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The Roll and Write Game</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The initial position of a certain number — typically 13, as the name suggests — of sheep over a 7x7 grid is given. Some grid edges are not available because there happen to be bushes: so you cannot fence them. The bushes do not protect the sheep either, the wolf can slide under them.</p>
<p>Your goal is to enclose as many sheep as possible: the ones that are not fully protected by fences may, alas, be at considerable risk when the inevitable wolf attack happens.</p>
<p>There are three main constrianing factors in this game:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shape of the fences that you can draw are determined by the roll of a die;</li>
<li>You cannot overwrite lines that are already drawn, you cannot also draw over bushes;</li>
<li>You have ~11 chances to place your randomly gifted fence shapes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out more about the game <a href="https://www.moritzdressler.de/en/13_Sheep">here</a>, where you can generate board layouts to print and play as well.</p>
<p>I found this game a lot of fun to play, and I thought it would be lovely to be able to play it on a computer, where the user can decide how many rounds, sheep, and bushes they want to play with. Given also that chatGPT has been apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/ammaar/status/1637830530216390658?s=20">remarkably adept at coding games</a>, I figured I’d give it a shot<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>I describe my conversation with chatGPT below, but if you just want to cut to the case and check the game out, you can find the playable version <a href="https://13sheep.netlify.app/">here</a> and the source <a href="https://github.com/neeldhara/13sheep/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s what we finally built:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/13sheep/finalui.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:100.0%"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The 13 Sheep UI</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And once you’ve finished playing you can share your accomplishment like so:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/13sheep/download.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="420"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">One of my completed games… where we protect five sheep, can you figure out how many rounds?</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<hr>
<p>So, back to chatGPT. My first prompt was just a polite inquiry about willingness to participate in this exercise:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>We want to code a game called 13 Sheep using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Ready?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And well, it immediately made <a href="https://13-sheep-v3-GPT4-v30.neeldhara.repl.co">this</a>, based on the prompt above: a game where you get to count to 13 sheep. Huh. Promising.</p>
<p>In my next few prompts, I steered it away from the default game. The first few steps just involved setting up the UI:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Great start! Please make the main canvas a square and draw a 7 x 7 grid in it. I want all the corners of the cells to look like small + signs. Do not draw any grid borders yet.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Nice, how can I make the grid background mediumseagreen?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>On load, I want 13 grid cells to be identified at random, and the image sheep.png to be placed at their centers, appropriately scaled to fit.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At this point I already had a nice-looking grid with 13 sheep on it (thanks to Flaticon for the cute sheep icon). The plus signs drawn on the boundary were oddly cropped out, so we fixed that next:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Ok this looks great. Can you update the drawcross function so that crosses are also drawn on the grid boundary? And make the canvas a little bigger if needed so the entire cross is visible?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This didn’t immediately work but some nudging fixed it:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>The crosses at the bottom are getting cut off and now the sheep are off center. Please fix?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>That worked — phew! Now we draw the bushes:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Very nice. Can you randomly select 7 cells now and for each such cell make one of the cell boundaries colored indianred?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Next we get the dice roll UI up:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Excellent. Now please add six divs below the canvas, centered, evenly spaced, and with a light grey circular background, with the text 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 written inside them. Note that the first div should have the text 1, the second should have 2, and so on. Make sure the divs have at least 10px spacing between them.</p>
<p>Below these divs, please add a large button in the shape of a rounded rectangle, with the text “Roll Dice” written on it. The background color for this button should be indianred with a transparency of 0.42.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This actually worked out of the box, the next step was to make the roll dice functional:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Super nice!</p>
<p>Now can you make it so that when the user clicks on the button labeled “Roll Dice”, we generate a number between 1 and 6 at random, and highlight the corresponding circular div by changing its background to Lavendar, while also resetting any previous highlight?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So far, so good. Now all that was left was to get the fences drawn depending on what dice was rolled out.</p>
<div class="callout-tip callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This was perhaps the trickiest bit. My first attempt was this prompt here:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Great! Now can you update it so that:</p>
<p>if the outcome of the dice roll is a 1, the cursor should change to a shape that looks like a U, and nothing outside the grid should be clickable. If the user clicks on a grid cell, then the left, bottom, and right borders of the cell should change color and become a thick line colored in olivedrab. Once the user has clicked on a grid cell the cursor should change back to normal.</p>
<p>if the outcome of the dice roll is a 2, the cursor should change to a shape that looks like a long line, and nothing outside the grid should be clickable, and none of the cells in the last column should be clickable either. If the user clicks on a grid cell, then the bottom border of the cell should change color and become a thick line colored in olivedrab, and the the bottom border of the horizontally adjacent cell should change color and become a thick line colored in olivedrab. Once the user has clicked on a grid cell the cursor should change back to normal.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>My hope was that the change of cursor would be a good way for the player to register that they need to move on the grid now. At this point, I was not thinking about the different orientations of the fences, because I was not sure about how to incorporate that into the UI (my first thought was to have the fences rotate on subsequent clicks until the player clicks on a confirm button, but that seemed too messy). I also did not give all six scenarios in one go since — from recent experience — the interface dies out on longer requests. You can prod it to continue from where it left off, but it’s typically messy.</p>
<p>In any case, we could not get the change of cursor to work. At this point, note that the code is also not tracking what borders are colored, so even as we got things to mildly work, we were often overwriting fences and bushes. So anyway, at some point I gave up and it was back to square one, but smaller steps. First, instead of a change of cursor, I just requested a canvas background color change to subtly communicate a change of game state:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Once the dice roll button is clicked, can you change the background of the canvas to dodgerblue with transparency 0.42, and disable the roll dice button until the user clicks on a grid cell?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then we added a round tracker:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Add the following text just below the “Roll Dice” button: “Roll a dice now, 11 rounds left”. Every time the user clicks on “Roll Dice”, change the text to “Place a fence now.” Once the user clicks on a grid cell, change the text back to “Roll a dice now, 11 rounds left”, but decrease the number of rounds by one each time. Can you do this?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This took some back and forth to get working, since it was getting some details mixed up, but it was finally alright. I had to prompt more to take care of some edge cases and minor details, for instance:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Anyway, can you make it so that when there are 0 rounds left, the text simply says “Game Over”?</p>
<p>Also when the roll dice button is not active, can it have a grey background? Only when it is not active.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now we are back to actually trying to get the fences to be drawn. With some nervousness, I go:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Very nice. Now, if the dice roll is a 1 and the user clicks on a grid cell, can you do the following?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>let us say that a cell is valid if the top, left, and bottom borders of the grid have no visible borders.</li>
<li>if the cell is valid, then make its top, left, and bottom borders colored olivedrab.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At this point the code generated starts tracking what borders are visible. I did have to prompt it explicitly to update the earlier function that generated the bushes to feed into the visibility states. However, this went off pretty smoothly overall. For quite some time the fences drawn when the user clicked a grid cell were not the ones I wanted, but after a few nudges it got it about right.</p>
<p>Now it occured to me that I could actually show the orientations after the dice is rolled and the user can select one of them, and we can draw the appropriate fence after this selection is made.</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Great. This works. Now below the instruction-text element, please add another div with ID “orientation-select” that begins with the text: “Pick an orientation”. Below this, add four circular divs with a light grey backgorund with the content: “0”, “90”, “180”, “270”. This div should only be visible when the gamestate is “chooseFenceOrientation” or “placeFence”.</p>
<p>Once a dice is rolled, the game state should change to chooseFenceOrientation and the user should be allowed to click any of these four divs. Once the user clicks one of the four divs, highlight it with the color burntorange and change the gamestate to placeFence. Store the choice of which div the user clicked on in a variable called fenceorientation and change the game state to placeFence.</p>
<p>Once the user clicks on a grid cell, clear the burntorange highlight and hide the “orientation-select” div, as it should not be visible any more.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of course in the UI at the moment we just have these four numbers so it does not make a lot of sense to the player, so I whipped some images to show the user what fences would be drawn depending on what grid cell was clicked.</p>
<p>Now we come back to the fence drawing thing to account for the orientations as well:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>In the handleGridClick() function, we want to implement the following functionality.</p>
<p>If the outcome is 1 and the orientation is 0, then do the following when the user clicks on a grid cell.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>let us say that a cell is valid if the top, left, and bottom borders of the grid have no visible borders.</li>
<li>if the cell is valid, then make its top, left, and bottom borders colored olivedrab.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the outcome is 1 and the orientation is 90, then do the following when the user clicks on a grid cell.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>let us say that a cell is valid if the right, left, and bottom borders of the grid have no visible borders.</li>
<li>if the cell is valid, then make its right, left, and bottom borders colored olivedrab.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the outcome is 1 and the orientation is 180, then do the following when the user clicks on a grid cell.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>let us say that a cell is valid if the right, top, and bottom borders of the grid have no visible borders.</li>
<li>if the cell is valid, then make its right, top, and bottom borders colored olivedrab.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the outcome is 1 and the orientation is 270, then do the following when the user clicks on a grid cell.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>let us say that a cell is valid if the right, left, and top borders of the grid have no visible borders.</li>
<li>if the cell is valid, then make its right, left, and top borders colored olivedrab.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please remember to use the drawBorder function from before as you work out these cases. Also remember to update the grid visibility values, for the two relevant cells per border drawn. Thanks.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Getting this going for all the 20 different cases was really the bulk of the back and forth. While it got the overall functionality right, there would be small and frequent bugs in the details. For instance, if a cell’s top border is being fenced, then the cell above it should have its bottom border’s visibility updated: it knows this, but frequently got combinations wrong, and so I did have to read the code generated carefully. I either fixed it manually when the bugs were minor, or went back to requesting corrections by explaining the issue when it was off by a whole lot.</p>
<p>You can see that some of the prompts are longer than the corresponding code :D</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Looks great! Lets continue with our updates. Please remember to account for all the cases when updating the grid visibility values.</p>
<p>If the outcome is 4 and the orientation is 0, then do the following when the user clicks on a grid cell.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>let us say that a cell is valid if its bottom and left borders are not visible and the horizontally adjacent cell (i.e, the cell to the right of it) also does not have a bottom border. if a cell is on the right-most column, it is automatically not valid.</li>

<p>Maybe it’ll soon be possible to just upload a picture of the game instruction booklet and let chatGPT do the rest of the heavy lifting. Until then, this was the best I could think of: maybe there’s a shorter way? I did try using generic shape descriptions, but no luck on those.</p>
<p>Now the basic game was done, and there were three main features I’d have really liked to add at this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the user undo the previous fence placement.</li>
<li>Count the number of protected sheep at the end.</li>
<li>Make a version of this game where instead of rolling a dice, we let the user pick the fences they want: this can be useful for a multiplayer setting where we want the random choices to be the same for all players: so one player can roll the dice and the others can follow along.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did try some of this: it’s impressive that chatGPT gets the main ideas right the first two requirements (the use of an action stack for implementing undo, and recognizing that we need some kind of flood fill algorithm for the score). However, all the implementations ended up being somewhat buggy and after some wrestling I decided to push these extras to the roadmap. The deterministic version of the game should not be hard to make, even manually at this point, so I hope to come back to it soon.</p>
<p>After this I mainly asked for chatGPT to let the user customize the parameters of the game:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Can you make it so that when the page loads we ask the user (via an alert) for a number between 7 and 32 and set the number of rounds to the number specified by the user?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It got this immediately right, and I wanted some styling:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Can you add some css styling so that this prompt looks nice?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>and it’s response was:</p>
<div class="callout-tip callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot directly style the default JavaScript prompt function. Instead, you can create a custom modal using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve a more visually appealing and flexible solution.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how you can create a custom modal to ask for the number of rounds:</p>
<p>…</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Good to know! The modals worked out of the box, and it was easy to extend them so they asked for the number of sheep and bushes as well. The last thing I wanted to add was a sharing feature:</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>Can you add code so that the user can share a screenshot of just the canvas once the game is over? So once the game is over, I want to show a link called “Share My Game!” The screenshot and options to share on social media should show up in a modal when the user clicks this link.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now this it did remarkably well, except that when it tried to pass the entire image as a URL parameter, that didn’t work out. When I conveyed this, the response was:</p>
<div class="callout-tip callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>I apologize for the inconvenience. The reason for this issue is that sharing an image directly using a URL is not possible due to security reasons. To share your game image on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, you’ll need to use their respective APIs.</p>
<p>Here’s a modified approach for sharing the image on Facebook and Twitter. You’ll need to create Facebook and Twitter developer accounts and register your app to get the API keys.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Whoa… so ok, I don’t have developer accounts and I was not going to follow through, but this was definitely interesting!</p>
<p>I did interleave responses from chatGPT with help from Ghostwriter, which is the intelligence built into repl.it out of the box. Ghostwriter’s responses were usually not as sophisticated on comparable prompts, but on a couple of occassions chatGPT was completely lost on why something wasn’t working, but Ghostwriter would figure it out when asked pointed questions about an error. There seems to be some potential that they will be a good team — possibly also alongside Copilot, which I did not use at all here.</p>
<div class="callout-caution callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-caption-container flex-fill">
The Final Product
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Anyway, long story short, I cleaned up a little further on my own, and finally: the game is <a href="https://13sheep.netlify.app">here</a>, the source is <a href="https://github.com/neeldhara/13sheep/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>My experience with chatGPT and Ghostwriter as pair programmers was — I daresay — rewarding overall. When I first thought of doing this, perhaps partially <a href="https://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi/status/1637058628187312134">intoxicated by all the hype</a>, I figured I could get this done in a couple of hours at the most: I estimated twenty minutes for functional code, and about a 100 minutes for making up my mind about colors and fonts. This was a vast underestimate: I think I spent close to a good twelve hours (including a couple of early throw-away prototypes, and all the failed attempts on the flood filling) altogether<sup>2</sup>… at some point it did get a little addictive, and perhaps there was a sunk cost argument for not letting go halfway through.</p>
<p>As someone who does not know javascript, I found this to be a part empowering, part learning, and mostly amusing experience. It felt like picking up a natural language by directly talking to mostly fluent speakers who made random and small mistakes. My overall sentiments were very similar to the process described <a href="https://twitter.com/ammaar/status/1637592014446551040">in this thread</a>, where <a href="https://twitter.com/ammaar">Ammaar Reshi</a> uses GPT-4, Replit, MidJourney, and Claude to create a 3D space runner from scratch with ZERO [sic] knowledge of Javascript or 3D game programming: you should check this out if you are interested in a much more sophisticated demonstration for deploying AI tools to make games!</p>
<p>In its current form I think this also has interesting implications for how programming is taught: I hesitate to elaborate any further on this given how likely it is that any commentary will be obsolete by tomorrow. But in the very near term, I can imagine that reading, analyzing, and even learning alongside chatGPT could make for interesting experiences in the classroom.</p>

  <title>Letters with Pandoc</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/pandoc-letters/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Letter-writing season is around the corner. I recently adapted <a href="https://github.com/yangjiandong/myPandoc/tree/faf94dc26487005b03baa7a2d807b20b2a7f233f/demo/letter">this pandoc workflow</a> for generating PDF letters by only editing a markdown file. I only made the following minor changes to the original:</p>
<aside>
For this to work you will need <a href="https://pandoc.org">pandoc</a> and a TeX distribution installed. For a full-fledged TeX distribution check out something like <a href="https://www.tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a> and for a minimal variation, see <a href="https://yihui.org/tinytex/">TinyTeX</a>.
</aside>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Included the <code>fontawesome5</code> package so I could add icons alongside the phone number, email, and website in the letterhead.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed <code>ThisULCornerWallPaper</code> to <code>CenterWallPaper</code> and added <code>wpYoffset</code> and <code>wpXoffset</code> so I could get a left margin on the logo (I suppose this <em>could</em> also be done by offsetting the logo in the <code>letterhead.pdf</code> file).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s what the output looks like with some random sample content:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/pandoc-letters/output.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:80.0%"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Sample letter produced with the pandoc workflow</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The markdown is very simple to edit — most of the information is up in the YAML header, and it looks like this:</p>

<p>Write the body of the letter in markdown as usual, and generate the PDF by running:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc letter.md -o output.pdf --template=template.tex --pdf-engine=xelatex</code></pre>
<p>or have a makefile that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>TEX = pandoc
FLAGS = --pdf-engine=xelatex

src1 = template.tex letter.txt
op1 = output

all : $(op1).pdf

$(op1).pdf : $(src1)
    $(TEX) $(filter-out $&lt;,$^ ) -o $@ --template=$&lt; $(FLAGS)</code></pre>
<p>For your first use, you would want to update the images for the letterhead and the signature, and optionally customize the fonts to your liking. <a href="https://github.com/neeldhara/pandoc-letters">Fork this repo</a> to make your own!</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The program takes all the available knowledge in the universe and extrapolates a score for each IIT using state of the art algorithmic techniques (i.e., deep guessing). To resolve ties, the program also computes a secondary score which is a random number. The program next computes a weighted average of the two scores - the weight assigned to the first score is based on its scientific value and merit, and is thus zero, and the remaining weight is assigned to the secondary score (i.e., 1). The program then sort and output the departments in decreasing ordering of their weighted scores.</p>

<p>You can find the original announcement <a href="../2022/">here</a> and more specifics clarifying the format (or the lack of it) <a href="../about/">here</a>. Here’s the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put up a piece of content everyday between 1st October and 30th October, with the possibility of skipping one day per week;</li>
<li>Post a link to your content on Twitter with #exportober</li>
<li>That’s it, actually. 🤷‍♀️</li>
</ul>
<p>Psst. It’s quite fine to sign up even if you’re reading this after the 1st of October. The automated tracking exercise here will stop after the 15th of November, so you can be a part of this by just contributing in this window. It certainly does’t <em>have</em> to be daily and it doesn’t <em>have</em> to be 30 things, although I found those to be useful default targets to work with for myself.</p>
<!-- ## Sign up! -->
<!-- While I'm not going to write a Twitter bot that will send you daily reminders over DM, I do hope to create a separate page for each registered participant at the end of the challenge that shows off just their entries in one place, so it's helpful to know who you are 😀 -->

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This is the text of a short speech I gave at the farewell event for <a href="https://sudhirjain.info/">Prof.&nbsp;Sudhir Jain</a> as he left IITGN for BHU.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>You can find out more about Prof.&nbsp;Jain’s own take on the cultural foundations of IIT Gandhinagar <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/about/cultural_foundations">here</a>, where he is in conversation with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/achal-mehra-13037931/">Achal Mehra</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield has said that leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It’s about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for others’ success, and then standing back and letting them shine. If that sounds familiar, I think it’s because we have lived this experience at IIT Gandhinagar, thanks to Prof.&nbsp;Jain.</p>
<p>Our guiding principles have been often unconventional — whether it’s about having students first, or choosing to trade short-term gains for the long-term vision. They have sometimes led to decisions that would seem quite inexplicable to anyone who did not have the context. Some of you might remember how early we started the undergraduate program in Computer Science, for example. Ok, so for the record, we started it quite late, at least according to conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>Crucially, these core values have always been articulated in collaboration, with inputs from all stakeholders, which is what enables our shared conviction in them once they have been established.</p>
<p>Prof.&nbsp;Jain’s vision for IIT Gandhinagar is as precise as it’s bold – he knew exactly what needed to be done for this place to emerge as a model institution. He had recently shared with us his roadmap for IITGN from a dozen years ago. This roadmap committed not to vague ideas but concrete goals, complete with numbers for metrics that are fraught with uncertainty. It’s absolutely stunning how everything panned out almost exactly according to plan!</p>
<p>Our narrative has many collaborators, including our students, faculty, and staff. And while some of us are relatively inexperienced, Prof.&nbsp;Jain’s trust in everyone has been hugely empowering. It manifests in many concrete ways – starting from wanting for students to be recognized as adults, to turning young colleagues into decision-makers… and this is why all of us have a deep sense of ownership for IITGN.</p>
<p>An environment that gives all of us the freedom to experiment and the leeway to fail is extremely enabling. This has led to a wide spectrum of wins, many that are quantifiable and others that are less tangible. If you want to get a sense of how good the times have been, just look around – the sheer beauty and the attention to detail that the campus embodies is an excellent symbolism for the inclusive, thoughtful, and innovative leadership that we have experienced. When it comes to how far we have come, I could go on… pretty much forever, so I’ll defer you to the website for more details.</p>
<p>It is impossible to imagine IITGN without you. This is your brainchild through and through. Despite knowing that you’ll not be distancing in spirit, we will miss having you nurture the institution in the hands-on manner that you have always done. Your passion for the IITGN mission – of being a breakout university while operating within the limitations and strengths of the IIT system – is contagious. I am sure you plan to double down on this even though you may have a few distractions going forward.</p>
<p>I recently watched Maanaadu, a movie based on the idea of a time loop. In such stories, the plot involves the protagonist experiencing the same day over and over again, and their goal, typically, is to find an exit. If there is one day that we could put into a time loop, it would be today, and there would be no need to get out of it.</p>
<p>In the meantime – on behalf of all of us, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for your commitment, trust, and friendship; for listening patiently, for leading tirelessly, and for fighting the good fight through tough times, and for the good times through tough fights – ok, I’m going to be out of time, here, clearly – so let me just say, thank you for everything.</p>
</blockquote>

  <title>External Communications</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/comms/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I finish seven years at IIT Gandhinagar today.</p>
<p>This year, I also concluded my stint with the Department of External Communications, which feels about as long. Indeed, little did I know that a casual remark that I had made during my interview<sup>1</sup>, about wanting to be a writer for as long as I can remember, was carefully noted — and magically my service responsibilities would end up being related to my childhood dream. A few days after I joined, I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/achal-mehra-13037931/">Achal Mehra</a>, who introduced me to <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/about/newsletter"><em>Connections</em></a>: a four-page newsletter that went places every quarter. In my mind, that conversation kickstarted my collaboration with what everyone fondly calls “comms”. Seven years later, I’m here to report that the journey has been fun and fulfilling in equal measure.</p>
<p>Through this post, I’d like to introduce you to the comms team: if you have been to IITGN for an event, read about us in the press, have recieved a newsletter from us, visited our website, or followed our social media: these are the folks who work behind the scenes on these fronts. Being a part of this gang has been a huge inspiration: everyone is talented but always willing to learn; their hard work is driven by a sense of ownership; and there’s plenty of wit to help beat the heat :)</p>
<p>Here’s collection of some randomly chosen memories: my hat-tip to a stellar team.</p>

<section id="hatim" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hatim">Hatim</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hatimsham/">Hatim</a> joined us in the summer of 2018 and worked with us for four years. This summer, he moved on to join the design unit at <a href="https://www.isdm.org.in/team">ISDM</a> as a Graphic Designer and Video Editor.</p>
<p>Hatim has had a creative flair from the get go. He’s been a part of several exciting projects, including being the person <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hatimsham/blog/pfbid02hWtj37tfFBSZiWmbe5yXTALMbDpG41YkGWtWZa4kxr25dysYdHnEjxZQMH6y5HcTl">behind the visuals</a> for Alok Kanungo’s book, <em>Glass Crafts in Northern India</em>. Also, <a href="https://twitter.com/iitgn/status/1285917964059869184">here’s a cool trailer</a> he put together very quickly for the ACM-W India Grad Cohort that I was involved in organizing in 2020.</p>
</section>
<section id="dilip" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dilip">Dilip</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dilip-kashyap-49aaaaa0/">Dilip</a> joined us in the summer of 2018. He had a distinct passion for developing mobile and web applications, and indeed, he’s been a huge asset to the web vertical of the team. He’s been relentless in learning new things and has been <a href="https://dilipkashyap15.medium.com/">writing on Medium</a> too.</p>
<p>When we were organizing the ACM-India Annual event and the team was freaking out over having upwards of 1000 registrations, Dilip wrote a mobile app for us — literally overnight — which allowed us to send all participants a QR code that they simply had to show to get through physical registration. It saved us a ton of time. You can find out more about Dilip <a href="https://dilipkashyap07.github.io/">here</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="tej" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tej">Tej</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tej-bahadur-gurung-8b94232a/">Tej</a> joined us in the winter of 2016 as a web developer and has been my officemate. Tej is among the first points of contact for all new faculty at IITGN: their institutional profile pages are set up even before they actually set foot on campus. Tej’s name is synonymous with “website”. If anyone needs one done, whether it’s for their lab, or an event, he’s always been an email away. True to an appropriate mispronouciation of his name<sup>2</sup>, Tej has remarkable turnaround times, and seems to get things done as fast as you can spell them out.</p>
<p>One of my most memorable projects with Tej (along with Dilip, Divyangi, and the rest of the team) is the revamp of the main IITGN website. We went from this:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>to this:</p>

<figure class="figure">

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The current IITGN website, <a href="https://www.iitgn.ac.in">here</a>.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>in about a year. Despite several very well-intended warnings about how crazy this was, the team picked up the project with cautious courage, and pulled it off. I think I can say with some confidence that the IITGN website is easy on the eyes, and things are not hard to find.</p>
</section>
<section id="apeksha" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="apeksha">Apeksha</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srivastava-apeksha/">Apeksha</a> joined us in the summer of 2019, just on the heels of completing her MTech in Biological Engineering at IITGN, and stayed with the team for a year. At the time of joining, she was an avid consumer of popular science material, and aspired to make the research at IITGN more broady accessible with her writing. She was a freelance writer already, and was looking for an opportunity to spend some time writing full-time. Her stint with us resulted in a number of articles, and her growth during the time has been remarkable. You can find her writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@apeksha.0503">her Medium blog</a>.</p>
<p>The ACM-W India Grad Cohort event we did in 2020 was a virtual one, and in the tradition of Grad Cohorts, was not recorded. I am grateful that Apeksha stepped up at the time, offered to attend all the sessions, and <a href="https://medium.com/@apeksha.0503/the-acm-w-grad-cohort-2020-women-conquering-computing-online-ca085623e396">wrote</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@apeksha.0503/grad-cohort-2020-day-1-of-the-women-virtual-workshop-in-computing-opens-with-a-bang-56407c113ad">up</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@apeksha.0503/acm-w-grad-cohort-2020-day-2-a-perfect-combo-of-motivation-and-quality-advice-from-women-leaders-3f2c629e05e5">comprehensive</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@apeksha.0503/day-3-acm-w-grad-cohort-2020-concludes-with-strong-networking-opportunities-and-professional-bc8c78efbc33">summaries</a>.</p>
<p>She has now joined the Ph.D.&nbsp;program in the Humanities and Social Sciences and is currently researching cognitive aspects of science communication with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_L._Coolidge.">Frederick Coolidge</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="dhara" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dhara">Dhara</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhara-vora-1019/">Dhara</a> joined us in the summer of 2018, and immediately got to work on managing our social media channels. She also streamlined the process of collecting information: a lot of what we do revolves around robust archival, and IITGN being a happening place does not make this easy! We get dozens of emails every day announcing events of varying scales, updates of various kinds.</p>
<p>Anticipating that the volume would only get worse, we devised a system for manually cataloging every bit of news in a bunch of Airtable bases. The long-term vision was that the Airtable API exposes this data to anyone who needs it: the web team could draw from it and filter appropriately to display upcoming events, an archival team could write a report generating app that used this as the backend, and so forth. We even had a web app developed by a team of undergraduates that pulled data from these bases to show off upcoming events on a big screen.</p>
<p>Dhara now manually curates information from these databases and runs a weekly internal newsletter collating what’s happened and what’s coming up at IITGN: this has been a major value addition for many. She also serves up the raw data needed for our public <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/about/newsletter">quarterly newsletter</a> and <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/about/annualreports">annual reports</a> based on this system, which saves everyone a lot of time. Apart from all of this, she is in the driver’s seat for all our <a href="https://twitter.com/iitgn">major</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iitgn.official">social</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/indian-institute-of-technology-gandhinagar-iitgn-/">media</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iit_gandhinagar/">channels</a>, and then some… and magically manages to stay on top of everything. You can <a href="https://medium.com/@voradhara46">find her writing on Medium</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="divyangi" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="divyangi">Divyangi</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyangi-chaudhari-404115140/">Divyangi</a> joined us in the summer of 2018 and worked with us for three years until the summer of 2021. She was a wizard when it came to scripting for automating tasks, and quickly became the go-to person for departments who were looking to improve their workflows.</p>
<p>IITGN runs on the Google ecosystem. Divyangi figured out several nice ways of bringing data from spreadsheets to frontends, generating reports, and so forth. She even ran a workshop on Google scripts and related tools as a part of an initiative coordinated by our Staff Development Cell.</p>
<p>Among the many projects Divyangi was involved in, one of my favorites was the backend for our rather popular <a href="https://srip.iitgn.ac.in/">Summer Research Internship Program</a>. The website is powered by WordPress, and provides various interfaces for both interns and mentors to keep track of their applications during the application phase (this runs into tens of thousands of records), and progress during the internship (updates from interns and feedback from mentors are all managed from here). Divyangi, together with Dilip, deeply customized the WordPress instance to provide a number of features that help with running a large-scale program smoothly, with most of the tedious tasks completely automated.</p>
</section>
<section id="chandni" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chandni">Chandni</h2>
<p>Chandni joined us in the summer of 2019 for a year. She was already a very talented photographer at the time of joining us. As our events and activities grew in number and scale, we found very valuable support in Chandni’s presence. Check out her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/visi_lens/">Instagram</a> here!</p>

<section id="vandana" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vandana">Vandana</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vandanay/">Vandana</a> joined us in the summer of 2017 in the role of a Communications and Media Officer for a year. During this time, she was working closely with local press and media, and ensuring that our stories are filed with them on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Vandana was already passionate about writing and had a keen eye for detail. She filled an important void at the time she joined and immediately setup various important foundations in the context of this role. She expanded our style guide, made a press kit, and developed a starting database of journalists that we could work with: these are all tools that the whole content team uses regularly to this day.</p>
<p>Her spirit of volunteerism meant that a lot of our content got reviewed and improved across the board: on the website, on our brochures, and so forth. This was also the time when we launched what I think is our best-kept secret: IITGN’s <a href="https://news.iitgn.ac.in">news blog</a>. Vandana, along with the rest of the team, setup a careful pipeline to ensure that everything we capture across press and social media gets a permanent home on the blog. She continues to pitch in remotely, even after moving on from her onsite role with us on campus.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivangi-bhatt-365b4a38/">Shivangi</a> joined us in the summer of 2018 in the role of a Communications and Media Officer, picking up from where Vandana left off. She has been synonymous with media and press at IITGN, and is currently our main interface with the press. She has substantially expanded on our network of partners in press, and ensures that we have the visibility we deserve in the local and national news, and even beyond. She is especially diligent about ensuring that regionally-focused news is appropriately translated in the local languages whenever appropriate, a widely appreciated effort.</p>
<p>Shivangi’s style has been remarkably proactive: if anything at IITGN is newsworthy, she makes sure it’s covered. She draws on her substantial experience in the field to bring nuanced insights to the table, and these have served us very well in our overall communications and outreach strategy.</p>
<p>Beyond coordinating stories for the press, Shivangi also comprehensively tracks IITGN’s presence in the news and other public domains, is closely invovled in the production of the <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/about/newsletter">quarterly newsletter</a> and <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/about/annualreports">annual reports</a>, and our social media activities as well. Shivangi is, unsurprisingly, an amazing writer, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shivangi.bhatt.501/blog/pfbid0CB5AGAkotx6cuXnYdNKGqVWc9jE7p3DrodzKTYGGDymSDWC4fxCJNer6bUrLCpJol">here’s a performance of hers</a> in a SDC event that was among my favorites.</p>

<section id="gaurav" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gaurav">Gaurav</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauravvipul/">Gaurav</a> has been around for longer than I have, and he is a founding member of the team. He is among the most versatile people I know: not only does the scope of his work at IITGN go well beyond communications, even within communications his skills span a very wide range: he’s behind the camera, he’s the person behind the design and layouts for some of our best print collaterals, he’s directed and produced a number of videos, and I could go on and on.</p>
<p>I’ve freely relied on his mentorship: much of the growth that has happened within the team, especially in terms of creative efforts, is thanks to Gaurav’s experience and guidance.</p>
<p>If you pick up any of our booklets, there’s a good chance that Gaurav has been involved in engineering the layout and design. Among them, I’ll single out a couple for you to sample: the <em><a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/assets/pdfs/brochures/faculty-brochure.pdf">World Class Faculty</a></em> brochure looks especially lovely in print, and the <a href="https://sites.iitgn.ac.in/10/index.php">10 on 10</a> brochure has a bold aesthetic that was a crowd favorite when it was released for our 10-year celebration.</p>

<section id="devarsh" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="devarsh">Devarsh</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dev_barbhaya/">Devarsh</a> joined us in the summer of 2017, with a background in creative film-making and theatre. He quickly became the go-to person when it came to anything to do with video or photography. Over the years here, he’s grown leaps and bounds in his craft and understanding of all aspects of the process — both work that happens on the field and in post.</p>
<p>Our YouTube presence was in its nascent stages when Devarsh joined. He’s single-handedly worked on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbOCAa_fRS1qEOknCmEHzVw">our channel</a> in mission mode from the get go, and it is largely thanks to his efforts that we have a fairly systematic video respository of most major events and talks on campus.</p>
<p>Devarsh has been involved in several memorable projects. Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZSAkpjsyZs">a video</a> that he shot for our first virtual convocation, which also happened to be among the first virtual convocation events to be held in India (as far as we know).</p>

<section id="nostalgia" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nostalgia">Nostalgia</h2>
<p>Some of the early members of the team are not pictured. Apart from everyone above, I had the good fortune to have worked with: Ritu (among other things, was the curator for all the early editions of the quarterly newsletter, <em>Connections</em>, and our annual reports), Dayanand (our first communications and media officer), Maria (our first social media intern), and Khushbu (who took over from Maria and preceded Dhara on managing social media).</p>
<p>It would be remiss of me to not give a shout out to the faculty support we have enjoyed over the years. Several colleagues have played major roles in helping out on all aspects of our responsbilities. A special thanks to Achal Mehra, who brought extensive experience to the table, and has been forever generous with his time and advice, and <a href="https://twitter.com/iitgn/status/1163406174626050048">Vasco Trigo</a>, whose inputs for the whole team were extremely timely and valuable.</p>
<p>I’ll also take this opportunity to thank friends at the Communications department at Duke University — they hosted us in the very early days, and their detailed and candid tour of various operational aspects was massively helpful in setting up a lot of the foundations back here.</p>
<p>I walked into this gig more or less by accident. I should confess here that I didn’t have a 5-year vision from which I could work backwards to nicely chunked milestones. There were no OKRs or KPIs or whatever else the pros do. A few times, it’s occurred to us that we should have targets, strategies, and systems<sup>3</sup>. While we never articulated any as far as I can remember, I think we did have a tacitly shared goal: it was to ensure that everyone got what they needed from comms, and that we didn’t make any mistake twice. My biases notwithstanding, I would say we have largely succeded :)</p>
<p>My time with this team remains special forever.</p>

<p>Conrad Barski (<a href="https://twitter.com/lisperati"><span class="citation" data-cites="lisperati">@lisperati</span></a>)’s latest, <a href="http://www.dogbunnypuzzle.com/">Dog Bunny Puzzle</a>, had <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32884467">jumped to #1 on HN</a>. The puzzle presents the following somewhat minimalist interface:</p>

</div>
<p>If you haven’t played it yet, you might want to go ahead and <a href="http://www.dogbunnypuzzle.com/">give it a shot</a> first. Most people figured out the mechanics without any explicit instructions. A couple of things that may not be immediately clear, but typically discovered quickly within a few moves:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The edges are labeled with conditions, and can be used only if <em>all</em> of the said conditions are met.</p></li>
<li><p>The bunny or dog icons may sometimes cover up what kind of location they are at. You can drag them away to find out!</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple animals can occupy the same spot at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to get into a dead end, a situation from where no legal moves are possible. In the verison of the game that is available at the time of this writing, the game offers no sign that you might be in this situation. This may <a href="https://twitter.com/lokshtanov/status/1571597503795167232">however change</a>.</p></li>

<p>So the last question may strike you as a bit left-field, but that’s what I’m going to ramble about for the rest of this post :) It turns out that the answer is in the affirmative, and <a href="https://twitter.com/lokshtanov/status/1571588360254410752">here</a> is a lovely reduction by <a href="https://twitter.com/lokshtanov"><span class="citation" data-cites="lokshtanov">@lokshtanov</span></a> showing as much.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-reduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-reduction">The Reduction</h3>
<p>Let’s just set up the game as a computational problem just to be sure that we agree on the abstraction. In fact, we’ll be working with a simpler version that we will call <code>BunnyCarrot</code>.</p>
<div class="callout-tip callout callout-style-default no-icon callout-captioned">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">

</div>
<div class="callout-caption-container flex-fill">
BunnyCarrot
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>In the <code>BunnyCarrot</code> problem, the input is a simple undirected graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G%20=%20(V,E)">, subsets <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C"> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V"> indicating the initial positions of bunnies and carrots, and a (possibly empty) instruction <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_e"> for every <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e%20%5Cin%20E">, which is a collection of conditions, <em>at least</em> one† of which must be true for the edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e"> to be “active”.</p>
<p>The question is if there is a sequence of movements of bunnies along active edges such that at the end of the sequence, every bunny is located at one of the vertices from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">.</p>
<p>† In the original version of the problem, we need <em>all</em> conditions associated with an edge to be satisfied, not at least one. The construction that we will describe can be easily adapted to this setting as well, but is simpler to describe for this variant :)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We are going to show that <code>BunnyCarrot</code> is NP-complete by reducing from <code>3SAT</code>. So let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi%20:=%20%5C%7BC_1,%20%5Cldots,%20C_m%5C%7D"> be a collection of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> 3SAT clauses over variables <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7Bx_1,%20%5Cldots,%20x_n%5C%7D">. The reduced instance of <code>BunnyCarrot</code> corresponding to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi"> looks like this:</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A cartoon sketch of the reduced instance of BunnyCarrot from 3SAT.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>What we have here is the following in terms of the structure of graph:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a path <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m+2"> vertices, with the left most vertex in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> and the rightmost one in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">;</p></li>
<li><p>a pair of vertices <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(u_i,v_i)"> for every <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20%5Cin%20%5Bn%5D">, and an edge between them, where all the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i">’s are in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">’ — the vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i"> represents the literal <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i"> while the vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i"> represents the literal <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coverline%7Bx_i%7D">;</p></li>
<li><p>a pair of vertices <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q"> in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">, with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> adjacent to all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i">’s and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q"> adjacent to all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i">’s.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now here be the instructions associated with the edges:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the edge to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell">-th vertex on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is active only if there is a bunny on at least one of the literals present in the clause <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_%7B%5Cell-1%7D">;</p></li>
<li><p>the edges between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i"> are active only when there is a bunny on the leftmost vertex of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">; and</p></li>
<li><p>finally, the edges incident on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q"> are active only when there is a bunny on the rightmost vertex of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-forward-direction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-forward-direction">The Forward Direction</h3>
<p>We first claim that we can “win” this game if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi"> has a satisfying assignment. Indeed, let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau:%20%5C%7Bx_1,%5Cldots,x_n%5C%7D%20%5Crightarrow%20%5C%7B0,1%5C%7D"> be a truth assignment that satisfies all the clauses of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi">. Then:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau(x_i)%20=%200">, move the bunny on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i">.</p></li>
<li><p>Move the bunny on the leftmost vertex of the path <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> to the rightmost vertex: note that all edges are active because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> is a satisfying assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Move all bunnies on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i">’s to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> and those on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i">’s to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q">.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="the-backward-direction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-backward-direction">The Backward Direction</h3>
<p>Now suppose there is a winning sequence of moves <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">. We will show that we can extract from this sequence a satisfying assignment for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi">, which will firmly establish the equivalence of the generated instance of <code>BunnyCarrot</code> with the OG hard instance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi">.</p>
<p>Note that to begin with, all the blue edges are inactive. Now, in the sequence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, let us say that a step is <em>key</em> if it involves a bunny moving along the first edge of the path <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> and <em>critical</em> if it involves a bunny moving along the last edge of the path <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">.</p>
<p>Suppose the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell">-th step is the first critical step in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">. Further, suppose that the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-th step is the <em>last</em> key step to occur <em>before</em> the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell">-th step. Notice that there must be at least one key step before a critical step — we must begin before we can end :)</p>
<p>Now, for all steps after the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-th step and before the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell">-th step, note that edges incident to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i"> are <strong>inactive</strong> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20%5Cin%20%5Bn%5D">. This implies that every step between the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-th and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell">-th steps involves a bunny moving along <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">, and in particular, every edge in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is crossed at least once in this phase of the game.</p>
<p>Let us note the positions of the bunnies who are on the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i">’s and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i">’s after the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-th step is executed. Observe that this naturally translates to an assignment on the variables as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Bequation*%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%5Ctau(x_i)%20=%0A%20%20%20%20%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%201%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Bif%20%7D%20u_i%20%5Cin%20B,%5C%5C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%200%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Bif%20%7D%20v_i%20%5Cin%20B.%0A%20%20%20%20%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bequation*%7D%0A"></p>
<p>We argue that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> must in fact be a satisfying assignment.</p>
<p>Assume to the contrary: suppose some clause <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_k"> is, in fact, not satisfied by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">.</p>
<p>Then, we claim that the edge connecting the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k">-th and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(k+1)">-th vertices is not active.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_k%20=%20%5C%7Bx_1,x_2,%5Coverline%7Bx_3%7D%5C%7D">. Since <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> does not satisfy <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_k">, it must be the case that:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau(x_1)%20=%200"> — and hence there is a bunny on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_1">;</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau(x_2)%20=%200"> — and hence there is a bunny on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_2">;</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau(x_3)%20=%201"> — and hence there is a bunny on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_3">.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the condition for the edge to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(k+1)">-th vertex on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> to be active is simply that there is a bunny present on at least one of the literals present in the clause <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_%7Bk%7D">, i.e, one of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_1">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_2"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_3">. However, because of the structure of the graph, and the fact that all edges incident on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q"> are inactive at all times before the first critical step, observe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a bunny on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_1">, there is no bunny on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_1">.</li>
<li>If there is a bunny on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_2">, there is no bunny on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_2">.</li>
<li>If there is a bunny on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_3">, there is no bunny on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_3">.</li>
</ul>
<p>By our assumption that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> falsifies <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_k">, <em>all</em> the premises above are true! So there is an edge on the path <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> that is not active between the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-th and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell">-th steps, which violates our understanding that every edge was crossed between these steps. This is a contradiction, and hence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> must indeed be a satisfying assignment.</p>
<p>I’ll just remark here that this construction can be modified so that every vertex in the graph has constant degree, and there is only one vertex in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">. It can also be modified to change the “or” condition on the edges to an “and”, by simply separating the conditions out along multiedges.</p>

These are some parts of the teaching statment that I wrote roughly seven years ago, updated slightly in the interest of clarity and additional context.

</blockquote>
<p>I’ll pose some how/what/why questions in the context of teaching.</p>
<section id="how" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how">How</h2>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The last couple of decades, especially the last few years, have seen dramatic changes in how information is communicated. A lot of learning happens in online communities, for instance, question-and-answer websites like Quora and StackExchange. Thanks to folks who invest time on these platforms, expert help seems to be nearer than ever before. Specialized and snark-free communities on Discord/Slack/Telegram are enabling peer-to-peer learning at global scale. </p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">I keep hearing that Quora is not what it used to be, but as long as <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Thomas-Cormen-1/">Thomas Cormen</a> is an active user, I am positive it remains a valuable resource.</span></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Books are beginning to be injected with exciting new technology: <a href="https://codemirror.net/index.html">CodeMirror</a> makes code interactive and runnable, while tools like <a href="https://pythontutor.com/">PythonTutor</a> can help with visualizing what happens behind-the-scenes when code is executed. <a href="https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs">Say</a> <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">what</a> <a href="https://wtfjs.com/">you</a> <a href="https://martin-thoma.com/javascript-wtf/">want</a> about JavaScript, but the interactivity that it brings to the written medium has helped make reading less passive. Some of my favorite interactive texts include <a href="https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/">Seeing Theory</a>, <a href="http://probmods.org/">Probabilistic Models of Cognition</a>, courses on <a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brilliant</a>, <a href="https://mathigon.org/">Mathigon</a>, and essays from <a href="https://ncase.me/">Nicky Case</a>, <a href="https://minutelabs.io/">Minute Labs</a>, and others on <a href="https://explorabl.es/">Explorables</a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">The name “PythonTutor” is slightly misleading, since the website also lets you visualize code snippets written in C, C++, Java, and JavaScript.</span></div></div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:45%;">
<p>And finally there are the online courses. At the time of this writing, it has been just a little over two decades since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_OpenCourseWare">MIT’s Open Course Ware</a> opened to the public. The early hype around MOOCs roughly coincided with my years in college and graduate school. As far as I remember, it was quite the thrill to have free-flowing access to online lectures — “taught by the best” — for several of the courses I was supposed to be doing as a part of my curriculum.</p>
</div><div class="column" style="width:4%;">

</div><div class="column" style="width:51%;">

</div>
</div>
<p>All this is to say that I walked into a career involving a substantial teaching component with plenty of hesitation. The delivery was/is still largely confined to classroom settings in broadcast mode. It is not entirely clear what this format has to offer over YouTube. Basic interactivity is being increasingly solved with questions built into video players. Peer learning is quite doable with WhatsApp/Slack/Discord groups and local chapter meetups. Scale in the context of assessments is somewhat addressed by peer evaluation. And then there are all the things you can do on YouTube that you can’t do with traditional lectures: find a teacher whose style resonates, find an accent you understand, replay, play at 2x, 0.5x, binge watch, don’t watch…</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>So: what’s the incentive for <em>anyone</em> to show up in a classroom at a fixed time, especially when said time is 8AM? This question became particularly relevant during the pandemic years: once the novelty wore off, almost nobody† showed up to lectures. If I was a student, I’d likely do the same. This remains largely an open problem in my mind, but here are some pointers that have kept me motivated about the conventional format. </p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">† Shout out to those of you accounting for the “almost”, thank you!</span></div></div>

<li>Classroom = theatre. I am increasingly treating it as a ground for practicing standup and <a href="https://twitter.com/neeldhara/status/1542606730701307904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">magic</a> skills. I should admit that this isn’t easy for a clinically shy person like myself, but I got used to making a fool of myself fast — that’s served well. I imagine that some of the fun that comes out performance-first lectures is hard to recreate with recordings and notes.</li>

<li><p>In a classroom setting, I can nudge the audience to discover things for themselves. As far as I know, the interactivity in online materials can help with validating understanding, but not as much with developing it from first principles. My hope is for learners to walk out of a classroom with the confidence that they <em>came up</em> with parts of the material in the textbook on their own.</p>
<p>Again, this is hard to do in time-bound fashion, given that a lot of this kind of understanding comes from brooding and hours of messing around. I can only hope to convince the audience that the process is worth the trouble.</p></li>
<li><p>The opportunity to show that you care. For learners who may have struggles with and beyond the materials — classrooms, labs, and office hours afford opportunities for us to offer help.</p>
<p>This was a late realization for me personally: for the longest time, my own sense of self-doubt did not allow me to see that I could potentially be useful to someone else. While self-doubt remains, I have started to compartmentalize it enough to show up for others.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All this said, I believe online and remote formats have substantial potential for making quality education accessible at scale, and that it is only a matter of time before classrooms in their most conventional forms either become obsolete or a ruse.</p>

<p>It is also increasingly challenging to formulate a curricula gets people to the bleeding edge starting from the foundations.

How crucial is it to develop competencies that don’t have an immediately visible ROI? How frequently do we <a href="https://twitter.com/ramgopal_rao/status/1566428352398774272">rewrite the textbooks</a> based on developments in industry?</p>
<p>I once read a collection of answers to the question of what <em>every computer science graduate should know</em> on a Q&amp;A site. As an aspiring graduate myself, I figured I should know what I should know. Unfortunately, I remember it as a mostly unnerving experience: it was a list that started with Voronoi diagrams and ended with incompleteness theorems, and a <em>lot</em> of things in between.</p>
<p>From the other side of the fence, for whatever it’s worth — the answer to this question <a href="https://twitter.com/togelius/status/1561738432422023175">remains elusive</a>, mainly because I think it’s a context-heavy issue. For better or worse, <a href="https://twitter.com/benmschmidt/status/1562256566631518208">there is a growing interest in computer science</a>, and it will likely remain a non-trivial challenge to find an approach that is both maximally inclusive and sufficiently useful. I can only hope that between ruthless efficiency in teaching things driven purely by need and a curriculum flooded with random adventures, we can find an balance appropriate to our contexts!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why">Why</h2>
<p>Given that everything that needs to be explained has more or less been done and dusted really well on the interwebs, personally, this is hardest question of the lot. Not from my own POV, that’s the easy bit - <a href="https://dsanghi.blogspot.com/2014/08/why-i-want-to-be-professor.html">as pointed out here</a>, it’s fun to go through the idea exchange process with a captive audience, and in my experience at least one party is sufficiently triggered at the end of it (hopefully in a good way).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The satisfaction that you get when you are able to explain a concept to someone who did not know it earlier is immense. Sometimes it could be straightforward, and sometimes it could be frustrating. But the end point is always the same - a smile on the faces of those students. Money can buy all the books, but can’t buy that smile.</p>

<p>I am just not sure if we create enough of a net positive in a traditional classroom setup from a ROI perspective. Given the few good things that the internet has brought us, perhaps it is time to think beyond classrooms and focusing on making existing resources more accessible to everyone who’s interested.</p>

<p>Putting <a href="https://twitter.com/neeldhara/status/1506794212590768130">this thread</a> in one place.</p>
<hr>
<p>🧵&nbsp;on our latest at FUN 2022 with <a href="https://twitter.com/NRAravind1"><span class="citation" data-cites="NRAravind1">@NRAravind1</span></a> and Harshil.</p>
<p>Have you tried Solo Chess <a href="https://twitter.com/chesscom"><span class="citation" data-cites="chesscom">@chesscom</span></a> yet? It’s addictive — and NP-complete* even when you’re dealing only with rooks!</p>
<p>*when appropriately generalized</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>So this is a single-player, peg-solitaire-ish chess variant, where you have to clear board by making a sequence of valid captures, albeit starting with unorthodox — and even unrealistic — positions.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/solo-chess/CleanShot_2022-03-24_at_04.30.34.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:42.0%"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">An example position</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>To begin with the boards start easy, with a few pieces at a time. Notice, even in the early games, how some positions have just one solution while others may have several.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/solo-chess/CleanShot 2022-08-30 at 08.46.16.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">More positions</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>From initial plays, you sense that it has a very Hamiltonian-Path-ish vibe, and feels like you’re trying to find a path in <em>some</em> graph 😅&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started with a variant that was simultaneously a generalization and specialization:</p>
<ul>
<li>n pieces 😎</li>
<li>♖’s only</li>
<li>1D boards 🙈</li>
</ul>
<p>This, it turns out, is case so special that its trivial - you can sweep all rooks to the extreme left or extreme right of the board, and any position is winning even if every rook can capture exactly once. Less trivial though: how many ways there are to win? 🤔</p>
<p>We also ask what happens if every rook had a designated number of captures left. Imagine you have a 1D board and three kinds of rooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>red rooks cannot move</li>
<li>blue rooks can move at most once</li>
<li>green rooks can move at most twice</li>
</ul>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/solo-chess/CleanShot_2022-03-24_at_04.47.53.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">1D Boards</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We show that such 1D boards can be cleared if and only if then number of green rooks is at least the number of red rooks. This ties nicely with the intuition that every immovable rook needs to be picked up by a rook that can help another one (i.e, &gt; one move left).</p>
<p>This generalizes naturally to rooks with a designated number of moves left, where said number can be anything between 0 and d.&nbsp;Since no other chess piece moves sensibly* across a 1D board, we decided to move on 2D boards from here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kings + rooks is an easy exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you are still playing with red, blue, and green rooks, then the problem of checking if a given 2D configuration can be cleared up according to solo chess rules turns out to be NP-complete.</p>
<p>No Hamiltonian Path though — this one was from bipartite dominating set 😎</p>

<p>Bishops are much the same as rooks, by a 45-degree tilt of the board.</p>
<p>⚠️&nbsp;Still open though: what about the case when all pieces have at most two moves left, which is closer to the original spirit of the game?</p>
<p>We don’t know yet, although we’d bet it’s hard, I think.</p>
<p>When playing with queens only, however, we can gadget in the behaviors of red and blue pieces. So we do have that Generalized Solo Chess with just queens that can all move at most twice is NP-complete.</p>
<p>What about pawns? Let’s get clarifying assumptions out of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>white pawns only</li>
<li>regular captures only since there’s no premise for en passant captures</li>
</ul>
<p>In solo chess, pawns are (heavily) constrained bishops: they can only move upwards and to a neighboring diagonal square. Knowing that bishops were hard, but pawns felt simple — we didn’t have a bet either way. 🤔</p>
<p>We were pleasantly surprised that the case of pawns is tractable, even when each pawn has a designated* number of moves!</p>
<p>*at most two.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>The algorithm is linear time, too.</p>
<p>Next: what about knights? We don’t know yet!</p>
<p>❓&nbsp;What’s the complexity of solo chess when played only with knights?</p>
<p>Knights are special because we don’t have to worry about obstructions. So the game can be described by a more general token game on graphs:</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The Graph Capture Problem</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We do show that Graph Capture is hard by a reduction, again from bipartite dominating set. This might hint at the hardness for Solo Chess played with knights only, but we are not betting on this yet.</p>

</div>
<p>I think these preliminary explorations have left us with more questions than answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimization versions (e.g, clear at least k pieces)</li>
<li>other constraints (e.g, on distance moved)</li>
<li>special cases (e.g, O(1) pieces per row/column)</li>
<li>n x c boards, constant c</li>
</ul>
<p>While at it, I’m also curious about how <a href="https://twitter.com/chesscom"><span class="citation" data-cites="chesscom">@chesscom</span></a> generates these puzzles, and if they have a mechanism for generating ones that have unique solutions. Also, is it true that if you throw “enough” pieces on the board, it’s solvable WHP?</p>
<p>Shout out to the <a href="https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/chess/skak">skak package</a> for making it easy to bring chess pieces to TikZ. We expect to put up a preprint on ArXiV soon. 👀&nbsp; Meanwhile, we welcome comments and feedback — and if you read this far, thanks very much!</p>

  <title>Eight Self-Sabotaging Behaviors</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/eight-self-sabotaging-behaviors/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Putting <a href="https://twitter.com/neeldhara/status/1503551801378881541">this thread</a> in one place.</p>
<hr>
<p>🧵 <span class="citation" data-cites="fortelabs">@fortelabs</span> recently finished the opening keynote on <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1498668781585014785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">the Second Brain summit</a>, which incidentally has a great lineup including a panel discussion on PKM through the lens&nbsp;of ADHD. Ironically, I didn’t quite take notes but I think the themes also feature in this short video:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKM2jE2PygY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>
<p>The live session was fun because of a super engaged chat — everyone had great suggestions for managing some of these (surprisingly common?) behaviors.</p>
<p>I’ll not share the premise (it’s self-explanatory + there’s the video), but the discussion involved three parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>why it’s an issue;</p></li>
<li><p>why-do-we-do-this-to-ourselves;</p></li>
<li><p>how do we not keep doing it 😀</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll share a tweet-length summary of my takeaways.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Caveat I: 280 chars! Twitter isn’t the platform for nuance. 😅</p>
<p>Caveat II. Should go without saying, but all of this gyaan needs to be tempered with context, which was a frequently used word throughout the session!</p>

  <title>Kidney Exchanges</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/kidney-exchanges/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This post is based on an excellent (chalk and board!) talk that <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~palash/">Palash Dey</a> gave at IIT Gandhinagar today. This is his joint work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/arnab-maiti/home">Arnab Maiti</a>, to appear as an <a href="https://aamas2022-conference.auckland.ac.nz/accepted/extended-abstracts/">extended abstract</a> at <a href="https://aamas2022-conference.auckland.ac.nz/">AAMAS 2022</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10250.pdf">preprint here</a>).</p>
<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_paired_donation">Kidney paired donation</a> or <em>paired exchange</em> allows donors to donate their kidneys to compatible patients with the understanding that their patients receive medically compatible kidneys in turn. The central problem in this setting is the <em>clearing problem —</em> which involves matching patients to donors in such a way that a maximum number of patients receive compatible kidneys. We introduce a directed graph as a convenient abstraction for this question, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>each node <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i%20=%20(P_i,D_i)"> represents a patient-donor pair, and</li>
<li>we introduce a <em>directed</em> edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i%20%E2%86%92%20v_j"> if the kidney of the donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_i"> is compatible with the patient <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_j">.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observe that a cycle in this directed graph naturally represents a sequence of feasible exchanges within the cycle. For example, imagine that we have a three-cycle with the edges:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(P_2,D_2)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_5,D_5)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_7,D_7)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_2,D_2)"></p>
<p>Then we have the following compatible donations:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_5"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_2"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_7"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_5"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_2"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_7"></li>
</ul>
<p>This accounts for all the patients and donors involved in this cycle and motivates the following question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Given a directed graph, what is the largest number of vertices that can be covered by a disjoint union of cycles?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While a positive answer to this question will “resolve” all the needs in the system, consider that exchanges along a cycle of length <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> involve <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> simultaneous operations to mitigate the risks involved with donors potentially backing out of the exchange agreements.</p>
<p>This motivates the following refinement of the previously posed question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Given a directed graph, what is the largest number of vertices that can be covered by a disjoint union of cycles, where each cycle is of length <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> or less?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the exchanges are restricted to swaps, that is, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20=%202">, the problem reduces to finding a maximum matching. However, the problem is NP-complete already when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20=%203"> (see Theorem 1, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/kidneyExchange.EC07.withGrantInfo.pdf">Abraham, Blum, and Sandholm</a>; EC 2007).</p>
<p>We now generalize the model a little further to account for the presence of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation#Good_Samaritan">altruistic donors</a>,</em> who are donors without a matching patient and are willing to donate to any compatible patient. To account for the presence of such donors, we modify our graph representation as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each node either:
<ul>
<li>represents a patient-donor pair <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i%20=%20(P_i,D_i)"> or</li>
<li>represents an altruistic donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_k%20=%20D_k%5E%5Cstar"></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The edges are as follows:
<ul>
<li>We have a <em>directed</em> edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i%20%E2%86%92%20v_j"> if the kidney of the donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_i"> is compatible with the patient <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_j">.</li>
<li>We have a <em>directed</em> edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_k%20%E2%86%92%20v_j"> if the kidney of the donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_k%5E%5Cstar"> is compatible with the patient <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_j">.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In this setting, note that we can also facilitate exchanges along <em>paths</em> as well, with the paths starting at the altruistic donors. For instance, if we have the path:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(D_7%5E%5Cstar)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_2,D_2)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_5,D_5)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_7,D_7)%20%E2%86%92%20(P_3,D_3)"></p>
<p>Then we have the following compatible donations:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_2"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_7%5E%5Cstar"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_5"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_2"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_7"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_5"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_3"> is assigned the kidney of donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_7"></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in this situation, the donor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D_3"> is relieved from any obligation to donate to a patient. We now update our problem statement to reflect the presence of altrustic donors and the possibility of facilitating exchanges along paths:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>🤝 Optimal Kidney Exchange Along Short Paths and Cycles</p>
<p><strong>Input.</strong> A directed graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G%20=%20(V,E)">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D%20%5Csubseteq%20V"> are source vertices; and positive integers <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_p">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_c"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">.</p>

<p>The main claim in the context of this problem is the following:</p>

<p>Here’s a high-level description of the algorithm (perhaps best approached with some prior familiarity with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4opS8Hpvc0&amp;list=PLEAYkSg4uSQ2jI2x3Bwm711Tmjj-E25Et&amp;index=19">color coding</a>). To begin with, notice that we may assume without loss of generality that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_p%20%5Cleq%20t"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_c%20%5Cleq%20t"> — intuitively, this is because if the permitted cycle and path lengths are longer than the number of patients we hope to cover, then we can simply look for cycles or paths of length <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> directly to begin with — if we find one, then we are done, and if none exist, then we “might as well” set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_p"> and/or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_c"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t-1">.</p>
<p>Now, if there is a solution that accounts for at least <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> patients, there is also one that involves at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2t"> patients and in particular, also at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> paths. Such a solution engages at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> nodes from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D">. Therefore, if there is a solution, then there is one that spans <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s%20%5Cleq%203t"> vertices.</p>
<p>As is standard for color coding, we guess the correct value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> and randomly partition the vertex set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V"> into <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> parts. The hope is that each part contains exactly one vertex from the solution (this is a so-called “colorful solution”). The probability that a random partition is a lucky one is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(3t)!/(3t)%5E%7B(3t)%7D">, which turns out to be at least <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e%5E%7B-3t%7D">. This implies that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e%5E%7B3t%7D"> repetitions ensure a constant success probability.</p>
<p>Given that the partition is indeed a lucky one, we can recover the solution using the following dynamic programming semantics. For <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C%20%5Csubseteq%20%5B3t%5D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20%5Cin%20%5B3t%5D">, let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%5BC,i%5D"> be <strong>TRUE</strong> if and only if there is a colorful solution spanning at least <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> nodes outside <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D"> in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G%5BV_C%5D">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_C"> denotes the subset of vertices colored with colors from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C">.</p>
<p>The recurrence is based on isolating one path or cycle by guessing the set of colors involved in said component and using table lookups to figure out if this can be extended to a full solution.</p>
<p>In particular, we have:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%5BC,i%5D%20=%20P%5BC,i%5D%20%5Clor%20Q%5BC,i%5D">,</p>
<p>where</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P%5BC,i%5D%20=%20%5Clor_%7B(B,j):%20B%20%5Csubseteq%20C%20%5Ctext%7B%20and%20%7D%201%20%5Cleq%20j%20%5Cleq%20%5Cell_c%7D%20%5BD%5BC%20%5Csetminus%20B,%20i%20-%20j%5D%20%5Cland%20f(B,j)%5D"></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q%5BC,i%5D%20=%20%5Clor_%7B(B,j):%20B%20%5Csubseteq%20C%20%5Ctext%7B%20and%20%7D%201%20%5Cleq%20j%20%5Cleq%20%5Cell_p%7D%20%5BD%5BC%20%5Csetminus%20B,%20i%20-%20j%5D%20%5Cland%20g(B,j)%5D">.</p>
<p>Here, we have that:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(B,j)"> is <strong>TRUE</strong> if and only if the vertices of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> can be covered with a cycle of length <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">.</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g(B,j)"> is <strong>TRUE</strong> if and only if the vertices of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> can be covered with a path of length <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">.</li>
</ul>
<p>The truth values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(B,j)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g(B,j)"> can be determined directly using standard approaches to finding colorful paths and cycles in time that is single-exponential in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">.</p>
<p>To claim the overall running time, note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of entries in the table is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%5E%7BO(t)%7D%20%5Ccdot%20t"> and each entry can be computed in time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%5E%7B%7D%5Cleft(2%5E%7B%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(%5Cell)%7D%5Cright)."></li>
<li>Therefore, the algorithm outputs the correct decision in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%5E%7B%7D%5Cleft(2%5E%7B%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(t)%7D%5Cright)"> time with probability at least <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e%5E%7B-3t%7D">,</li>
<li>By repeating <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%5Cleft(e%5E%7B3%20t%7D%5Cright)"> times, we find the correct decision with constant success probability.</li>
<li>The overall running time is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%5E%7B*%7D%5Cleft(2%5E%7B%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(t)%7D%5Cright)">.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-results">Other Results</h2>
<p>As Palash mentioned in his talk, the preprint has more, and here are some highlights of the other results that were established:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Optimal Kidney Exchange Along Short Paths and Cycles is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_complexity#FPT">FPT</a> also when parameterized by the treewidth of the underlying graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?+"> maximum length of path <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft(%5Cell_%7Bp%7D%5Cright)+"> maximum length of cycle allowed <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft(%5Cell_%7Bc%7D%5Cright)"> and the number of vertex types<sup>1</sup> when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_%7Bp%7D%20%5Cleq%20%5Cell_%7Bc%7D">.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadic_second-order_logic">Monadic second-order formula</a> for the problem is also presented, where the length of the formula is upper bounded by a function of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell=%5Cmax%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%5Cell%7Bc%7D,%20%5Cell_%7Bp%7D%5Cright%5C%7D">.</p></li>
<li><p>The problem admits a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernelization">polynomial kernel</a> with respect to the number of patients receiving kidneys <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?+"> maximum degree when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmax%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%5Cell_%7Bp%7D,%20%5Cell_%7Bc%7D%5Cright%5C%7D"> is a constant.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, the problem does <em>not</em> admit any polynomial kernel parameterized by the number of patients receiving kidneys <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?+"> maximum degree <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?+%5Cmax%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%5Cell_%7Bp%7D,%20%5Cell_%7Bc%7D%5Cright%5C%7D"> (under standard assumptions).</p></li>
<li><p>A <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cleft(16/9+%5Cepsilon%5Cright)">-approximation algorithm is presented for the case when only cycles of length at most 3 are allowed and no paths are allowed.</p></li>

<section id="pointers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pointers">Pointers</h2>
<p>Some discussion that came up during the talk:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The so-called dual parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(n-t)">, which in this case corresponds to the number of patients who were “left out”, is perhaps a natural parameter to study as well.</p></li>
<li><p>The notion of a patient without a matching donor seems complementary notion of altrusitic donors. Such patients would be the last vertices on paths kickstarted by altruistic donors. However, this notion likely does not manifest in practice.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you’d like to dig deeper, be sure to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10250.pdf">check out the preprint</a>! A few additional pointers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This work closely builds on the works of <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/77">Xiao and Wang</a> (IJCAI, 2018), who proposed an exact algorithm with running time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(2%5Enn%5E3)"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> is the number of vertices in the underlying graph. They also show an FPT algorithm parameterized by the number of vertex types if we do not have any restriction on the length of cycles and chains.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/12/2/50">Lin, Wang, Feng, and Fu</a> (Algorithms, 2019) studied the version of the kidney exchange problem which allows only cycles and developed a randomized parameterized algorithm with respect to the parameter being (number of patients receiving a kidney, maximum allowed length of any cycle).</p></li>
<li><p>Alvin E. Roth was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences 2012 (along with Lloyd S. Shapley) in part for his pioneering contributions to the theory and practice of kidney exchange — his <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2012/roth/biographical/">biographical account</a> indicates that he had started anticipating the problem even before it emerged as a legal practice. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exB1O3pTf7E">talk at Simons Institute</a> surveys “fifteen years of history” in the kidney exchange problem, with an emphasis on the game-theoretic aspects. (h/t: <a href="https://csatravelblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/05/rohit-vaish-cmu-visit/">Rohit’s blog</a> on this topic.)</p></li>

<li id="fn1"><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01623.pdf">Dickerson, Manlove, Plaut, Sandholm, and Trimble.</a> (EC 2016) introduced the notion of “vertex type” and showed its usefulness as a graph parameter in real-world kidney exchange instances. Two vertices is said to have the same vertex type if their neighbourhoods are the same.↩︎</p></li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Here’s a list of books — in no particular order — about women in mathematics (broadly interpreted) largely taken from <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenstrogatz/status/1495030448904458243">this thread</a>. The links are mostly to versions of the books on Amazon India. Unfortunately many of them are rather expensive, but hopefully it’s a handy list to share with a librarian you know! Do leave a comment below if you have any additions.</p>
<p>I’ll also leave this <a href="https://twitter.com/virtualcourtney/status/1495076053257175040">relatively sobering thought</a> (or <a href="https://twitter.com/MarissaKawehi/status/1495083281766879243?s=20&amp;t=9CWcnFgcqBQZD4p01UFXsg">this one</a>) here with no further comment.</p>

  <title>On the Communication Complexity of Equality</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>These are some quick sketchnotes based on&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orOJRhlqrvk">this lecture</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/">Ryan O’Donnell</a>, a part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prI35GmCon4&amp;list=PLm3J0oaFux3ZYpFLwwrlv_EHH9wtH6pnX">playlist</a>&nbsp;for the awesome&nbsp;<a href="https://www.diderot.one/course/28/">CS Theory Toolkit</a>&nbsp;course. You can walk through the arguments below.</p>

</iframe>
<p>I should mention that while the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/">Schwartz-Zippel-DeMillo-Lipton lemma</a> is invoked in the notes below, one could make do with just the fact that over any field <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F">, any degree <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> polynomial has at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> roots, as pointed out by <a href="https://twitter.com/dsivakumar"><span class="citation" data-cites="dsivakumar">@dsivakumar</span></a> — thanks!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
In the fourth slide from the end, why [DeMillo–Lipton]–Schwartz–Zippel Lemma? You only need that number of roots of a polynomial (over Z mod q) of degree n is no more than n.&nbsp;You don't need D-L/S/Z, which gives a general version for multivariate polynomials, right?

  <title>Two approaches to the 15 puzzle</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/15-puzzle/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Presenting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle">15 puzzle</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is a sliding puzzle having 15 square tiles numbered 1–15 in a frame that is 4 tiles high and 4 tiles wide, leaving one unoccupied tile position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307%2F2369492">Johnson &amp; Story (1879)</a> used a parity argument to show that half of the starting positions for the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-puzzle are impossible to resolve, no matter how many moves are made. We are going to explore two approaches* parity-based argument to show that the puzzle shown here on the right is unsolvable.</p>
<p>*I do believe the two proofs are essentially the same with slight differences of language.</p>

<p>Common to both approaches is the idea of associating a <em>permutation</em> with every state of the puzzle. For the purposes of this discussion, we will think of a permutation simply as a sequence of elements. To turn the grid layout into a sequence, you could, for instance, line up the rows next to each other, in other words, read off the numbers from left-to-right and top-to-bottom:</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Associating the puzzle with a permutation</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>So we think of every puzzle state as a permutation over the set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7B1,%202,%20%5Cldots,%2015%5C%7D%20%5Ccup%20%5C%7B%5Cstar%5C%7D">, where we use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cstar"> to denote the blank space. For a particular sequence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> and an index <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20%5Cleq%20i%20%5Cleq%2016">, we will use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma_i"> to refer to the element that is at the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%5E%7Bth%7D"> position in the sequence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">.</p>
<p>A couple of definitions in the context of permutations will be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <em>inversion</em> is a pair of elements that is out of their natural order. More precisely, if we have indices <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20%3C%20j"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma_i%20%3E%20%5Csigma_j">, then the pair <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,j)"> indulges in an inversion. Note that the starting state of our puzzle here has exactly one inversion.</li>
<li>A <em>transposition</em> of locations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> **is essentially a swap of the elements at positions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> of a given permutation. So this is an operation performed on a permutation. Let’s say this again with more explicit notation — if we start with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, then the permutation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> obtained from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> by a transposition of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> is given by the following:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctau_%5Cell%20=%20%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%5Csigma_j%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Bif%20%7D%20%5Cell%20=%20i,%5C%5C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%5Csigma_i%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Bif%20%7D%20%5Cell%20=%20j,%5C%5C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%5Csigma_%5Cell%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Botherwise.%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%0A"></p>
<p>The identity permutation, which we will denote by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ciota">, is special — it’s the following sequence:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5C%7B1,2,%5Cldots,14,15,%5Cstar%5C%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>It turns out that <em>every permutation</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> can be obtained from the identity permutation by a sequence of transpositions. This is not terribly hard to see — start with the identity permutation, and repeat the following until the permutation at hand is the one you want to see: find a location <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> that’s messed up in the current permutation, i.e, it doesn’t have the element you need in there. Find where the element is in the current permutation, and if that’s location <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">, you could perform a transposition between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">. This fixes up the location <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">. In every step, you fix at least one location, and never mess up anything else: so at the end of at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> steps (assuming you are working with a sequence of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> elements), you would be done. 🎉</p>
<p>For example, suppose the permutation you want to obtain is 3,4,2,1. Here is how the argument above would play out:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>1,2,3,4. The first location is messed up, so swap 1 and 3.</li>
<li>3,2,1,4. The second location is messed up, so swap 2 and 4.</li>
<li>3,4,1,2. The third location is messed up, so swap 1 and 2.</li>
<li>3,4,2,1. Now we are done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this may not be the only way of performing a sequence of transpositions that can morph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ciota"> into <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> — there may be various roads to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">. However, it turns out that no matter what route you take to transform <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ciota%20%5Clongrightarrow%20%5Csigma">, the <em>number of steps you perform will always have the same parity.</em> So specifically, it’s <em>not possible</em> for you to have a series of, say, seventeen transpositions that turn <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ciota"> into <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, and for me to have a series of forty-two transpositions that do the same. We will take this <del>as a cute exercise for the reader</del> as given.</p>
<p>This partitions the set of all permutations into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>even permutations:</strong> those permutations that are reachable from the identity with an even number of transpositions</li>
<li>odd <strong>permutations:</strong> those permutations that are reachable from the identity with an odd number of transpositions</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact from the previous paragraph above makes this classification unambiguous.</p>
<p>Alright, so now we have all the terminology we need to get to the argument about why the puzzle state we started with is unsolvable. We can roll up our sleeves and get started.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first line of argument is based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1WqYKHi78&amp;vl=en">this Numberphile video</a>, and is also the one described <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf">in this 1999 American Math Monthly article by Archer</a>. We begin with the observation that every move in the game is really a transposition behind the scenes. In particular, let’s say that we are currently in state <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> and we perform some move and move to state <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. Let’s say the permutation associated with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> and the permutation associated with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. It’s not hard to see that:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> can be obtained from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> with a single transposition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, note that the permutation corresponding to our target state is the following:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/15-puzzle/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_11.04.12_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The permutation corresponding to our target state</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In terms of the game state, notice that the final state has the blank tile at the bottom-right corner, just like we had at the start state. This means that in a hypothetical sequence of moves that morphs the initial game state into this solved state, we must have performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>an equal number of left and right moves; and</li>
<li>an equal number of up and down moves.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is not the case — imagine the blank tile traveling through the board as you perform the moves — if the number of times you moved in opposite directions did not exactly cancel, it would be impossible for the blank location to be back at it’s original location.</p>
<p>So in any winning sequence, the number of moves performed must be even. This implies that the permutation corresponding to the start state, in particular, can be obtained from the identity permutation with an even number of transformations. That makes the starting permutation an even permutation.</p>
<p>However, the permutation corresponding to the start state that we have been handed out is clearly an odd permutation: it can be obtained from the identtiy permutation by a transposition of the elements at the 14-th and 15-th positions. So, well, no dice! This shows that every solvable state that places a blank tile at the bottom-right corner must correspond to an even permutation. This does <em>not</em> automatically imply that all such states associated with even permutations are solvable* — it just shows that states with blank tiles at the bottom-right corner corresponding to odd permutations are firmly out of reach.</p>
<p>*It does turns out that all even permutations are in fact solvable.</p>
<hr>
<p>The second approach is based on the notion of inversions. This one is based on <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-3-strong-induction/">the Strong Induction lecture</a> in the MITOCW course on Mathematics for Computer Science. For this proof I’ll actually switch to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%20%5Ctimes%203"> version of the puzzle because <del>I don’t know how to extend it to the 15-puzzle</del> the case analysis is more manageable for this version:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/15-puzzle/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_11.30.57_PM.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:77.0%"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A move in the 3 X 3 version of the puzzle</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As we said before, the permutation associated with the starting point of the puzzle has exactly one inversion, while the permutation associated with the solved state, which is the identity permutation, has no inversions. So, when you make a move in the puzzle, what happens to the number of inversions?</p>
<p>As before, let’s say that we are currently in state <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> and we perform some move and move to state <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. Let’s say the permutation associated with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> and the permutation associated with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. Let us say that a pair of elements <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(p,q)"> is affected by a move in the game if the relative order of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q"> is different in the permutations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. Now we have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>if we perform a row move, the relative order of all elements corresponding to numbers remains the same — in particular, all affected pairs involve <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cstar"> — so the number of inversions in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> is exactly the same as the number of inversions in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">.</li>
<li>if we perform a column move, typically the element that is being moved, say <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">, ends up effectively jumping over two other elements, say <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b">. In this case the following scenarios arise:
<ul>
<li><p>Neither <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(p,a)"> nor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(p,b)"> is an inversion in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The long and short of all this is that after every move, the number of inversions <em>either remains the same or changes by two.</em> So no matter how many moves you perform, a state whose associated permutation has an odd number of inversions is going to remain inaccessible.</p>
<p>Tada!</p>
<hr>
<p>So there we have it… I have a feeling that a little bit of language connecting transpositions and inversions will really make these proofs quite identical, at least for the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%20%5Ctimes%203"> case — although I did worry that the first approach seemed to rely rather explicitly on the location of the blank tile while the second one didn’t. It is quite possible that the first one actually demonstrates more than I’m giving it credit for!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to be honest, I haven’t thought much about pushing the second line of attack to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4%20%5Ctimes%204"> case — it seems already that the statement about the change in the number of inversions is no longer true and the change itself is no longer two: in particular, it could apparently go up or down by three or one instead, since the element involved in the action, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> is now potentially jumping over <em>three</em> other elements, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c">… so this, at least from an immediate consideration, doesn’t quite take us where we want to go.</p>
<p>Possibly one has to work with a somewhat different invariant, maybe a notion of inversions that involve triples instead of pairs? Any comments on this would be very welcome, and I’ll have an update once I understand this a little better!</p>

  <title>Sam I Am</title>
  <link>https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/cp/sam-i-am/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This is mostly about solving Sam I Am (<a href="https://onlinejudge.org/external/114/11419.pdf">UVa 11419</a>); en route, we will end up discovering Kőnig’s theorem, which is a delightful fact about the special relationship shared by vertex covers and maximum matchings in bipartite graphs.</p>
<section id="the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Here’s an abridged version of the problem statement.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Sam is facing a temple which can be described by a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20%5Ctimes%20n"> grid and <strong>he has the locations of all enemies in the temple</strong> (each location can be thought of as the intersection of a row and a column in this grid).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of a sudden, he realizes that he can kill the enemies without entering the temple using the great cannon ball which spits out a gigantic ball bigger than him killing anything it runs into and keeps on rolling until it finally explodes.</p>
<p><strong>But the cannonball can only shoot horizontally or vertically and all the enemies along the path of that cannon ball will be killed.</strong></p>
<p>Sam wants to know the <strong>minimum number of cannon balls</strong> and the positions from which he can shoot the cannonballs <strong>to eliminate all enemies</strong> from outside that temple. &gt;</p>
</section>
<section id="some-initial-observations-with-an-example" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="some-initial-observations-with-an-example">Some initial observations with an example</h2>
<p>So to begin with, we have a grid with some cells identified as locations where Sam’s enemies are positioned, and here’s an example:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.003.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A first example of a configuration of Sam’s enemies location</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Conveniently for us, the enemies don’t move around.</span></div></div>
<p>We want to <em>hit</em> all of these locations, and what we have at our disposal is giant cannon balls which can destroy all enemies that are positioned on a single row, or a single column. For example, if we were obsessed about only firing along rows, we would need four cannon balls to tackle ’em all, like so:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.006.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A solution were we fire along rows alone</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If Sam was superstitious about shooting along columns only, then he would again need four of these cannon balls to take care of everything:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.007.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A solution were we fire along columns alone</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>However, our friend Sam is smart, not superstitious! And if there is anything that he is obsessed about, it is ruthlessly optimal destruction! In other words, he wants to fix everything up, but while using the smallest number of cannon balls possible… and if that means mixing up ranks and files, so be it — notice that you can manage with just three once you combine the use of both axes:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.008.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A solution leveraging a combination of rows and columns</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And for this example in particular, notice that three cannon balls are <em>necessary</em>, because we have at least three enemies positioned at locations that share <em>neither a row nor a column</em>, implying that no row-fire or column-fire can handle more than one of these locations at once:</p>

</div>
<p>So for this example, we know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>three cannon balls are necessary &amp;</li>
<li>three cannon balls are sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, let’s say that two enemy positions are <em>mutually independent</em> if they are on different columns <em>and</em> on different rows. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> be the size of a largest collection of mutually independent positions. Then it is clear that:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> cannon balls are necessary to handle all enemy locations;</li>
</ul>
<p>because any <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> fires that handle <em>all</em> enemy locations must in particular handle these <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> mutually independent ones, and each individual fire can get to (at best) one of them — by definition of what it means for two positions to be mutually independent. So if we have a valid solution involving <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> cannon balls, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20%5Cgeq%20k">.</p>
<p>What is a less obvious, but considerably fascinating, is the fact that:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is always a strategy to hit <em>all</em> locations using just <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> cannon balls. 🤯</li>
</ul>
<p>A striking situation, no pun intended — the obvious estimate of what is needed turns out to be enough as well! The easy lower bound has a matching upper bound ❤️</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-auxiliary-graph">An auxiliary graph</h2>
<p>Alright, I think that’s enough with the advertising.</p>
<p>How does this work?</p>
<p>Let’s construct the following graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G%20=%20(V,E)"> associated with the grid and the information about enemy positions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a vertex for every row in the grid; say <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_i"> for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20%5Cleq%20i%20%5Cleq%20m">. These are the <em>row vertices.</em></li>
<li>Introduce a vertex for every column in the grid; say <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_j"> for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20%5Cleq%20j%20%5Cleq%20n">. These are the <em>column vertices.</em></li>

<p>Observe that:</p>

<li>Any matching in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> (a collection of mutually disjoint edges) corresponds to a collection of mutually independent enemy positions back in the grid.</li>
<li>What we are looking for is a smallest-sized subset <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V(G)"> such that every edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e"> in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> has at least one of its endpoints in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S">. Such a subset is called a vertex cover.</li>

<p>So our claim in the language of grids now translates to:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>📝 The size of a maximum matching in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> is equal to the size of a minimum vertex cover in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the language of graphs. Keep in mind that as graphs go <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">, happens to be a bipartite graph; which is to say that its vertex set can be parittioned into two parts† such that every edge has exactly one endpoint in each part.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bring-in-the-flows">Bring in the flows</h2>
<p>Is this much ado for nothing? We seem to have done some translation work, but there’s no proof of this bold claim in sight just yet… 😬</p>
<p>Fair. So here’s a roadmap for what we plan to do next:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> as the basis of a flow network.</li>
<li>Recall the maxflow-mincut duality.</li>
<li><del>Profit.</del> Show the duality that we are interested in by hooking it up the known one.</li>
</ul>
<p>So first things first: we are going to setup a flow network around the graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">, and here’s a partial picture of what it looks like:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.032.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The flow graph</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Here’s the official description of how we build this up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">, and orient every edge between a row vertex and a column vertex so that every such edge originates <em>from</em> the row vertex and latches on <em>to</em> the column vertex.</li>
<li>We assign infinite capacities to all the edges in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">. Go unlimited on the originals! We will even dub these edges <em>original edges</em> going forward.</li>
<li>Add a source vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> and add unit-capacity edges <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(s,r)"> for every row vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r">. We will call these edges the <em>row selectors.</em></li>
<li>Add a target vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and add unit-capacity edges <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(c,t)"> for every column vertex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c">. We will refer to these edges as <em>column selectors.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it, that’s the flow network <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Ctilde%7BG%7D,%5Ckappa)"> based on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">, where I’m using <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa"> to denote the capacity function. Now let’s stare at any valid integral flow in this network — what does it pull out from the middle? 🤔</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.035.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A matching hiding in plain sight</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Let’s make the following quick observations in the context of a valid integral flow <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Ctilde%7BG%7D,%5Ckappa)">:</p>
<ul>
<li>The flow on any edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e"> from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> (i.e, an original edge) is either zero or one. Indeed, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(e)%20%3E%201">, then we violate conservation constraints at both endpoints of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e">.</li>
<li>For any row or column vertex, at most one original edge incident to it is used by the flow <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f">. In other words, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(e)%20=%200"> for all but at most one original edge incident to any row or column vertex. Again, if not, combined with the fact that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> is integral and that the row and column selectors have unit capacity, we will violate conservation constraints on the vertex under consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these observations, we have that the set of original edges for which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(e)%20=%201"> forms a matching in back in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">, and in particular, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> was maximum flow, then this set would correspond to a maximum-sized matching. Now, let’s look at the corresponding mincut by building the residual graph:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.040.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Edges in the residual graph that have a residual capacity of zero are not shown. Also, the original edges that were used by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> have infinite residual capacity but their corresponding back-edges have unit capacity, but this distinction is not emphasised in the picture because it’s not particularly relevant to our discussion.</figcaption><p></p>

</div>
<p>Edges in the residual graph that have a residual capacity of zero are not shown. Also, the original edges that were used by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> have infinite residual capacity but their corresponding back-edges have unit capacity, but this distinction is not emphasised in the picture because it’s not particularly relevant to our discussion.</p>
<p>and considering what vertices are reachable from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The vertices reachable from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> are marked green, while all remaining vertices are marked red.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The vertices reachable from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> are marked green, while all remaining vertices are marked red.</p>
<p>In the residual graph, I would like to draw your attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>row vertices that are unreachable from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">,</li>
<li>column vertices from where it is impossible to reach <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will refer to these vertices as the <em>misfits —</em> they are highlighted for you in the picture below:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.044.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The misfits</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now roll up your sleeves for some magic. Let’s pull up the cut — which we know is in fact a mincut — obtained by considering the set of vertices reachable from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> the residual graph corresponding to the maxflow <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f">. In pictures, note how we have attracted some column vertices to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">-side, and pushed away some row vertices to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-side:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.neeldhara.com/blog/cp/sam-i-am/CP-Week09-Mod03.046.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Some reorganization</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Note that this is a minimum cut, that is to say, the total capacity of the edges crossing the cut is as small as possible — which means that, in particular, the total capacity is at least (or should that be at most?) finite, and that implies, even more particularly, that <em>none</em><sup>1</sup> of the original edges cross this cut.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Remember how their capacities were infinite? So they just cannot afford to cross a minimum-capacity cut.</p></li></div></div>
<p>So every original edge is confined to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">-camp or the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-camp; but note that every original edge is an edge between a row vertex and a column vertex; so if you put two and two together, you see that, in fact, <em>every edge must be incident to a misfit vertex.</em> This means that the misfits are what we were looking for all along — they form a vertex cover of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G">!</p>
<p>So at least we have <em>some</em> solution. Is this the best we can hope for?</p>
<p>Why yes!</p>
<p>Note that every misfit vertex contributes <em>exactly one unit-capacity edge</em> to the minimum cut: the misfits on the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">-side are incident to column selectors, and these edges connect with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> on the other side; while misfits on the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">-side are incident to row selectors, and these edges connect with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">, which is again on the opposite end. So every misfit vertex contributes exactly one edge to the minimum cut — and there are no other edges that cross the cut, so we have the following sequence of equalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>size of the proposed solution = #misfits</li>
<li>#misfits = capacity of the minimum cut</li>
<li>capacity of the minimum cut = value of the maximum flow</li>
<li>value of the maximum flow = size of a maximum matching back in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"></li>
<li>size of a maximum matching back in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> = lower bound on our solution</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we have proposed a solution whose cost matches a lower bound on it, making it optimal! With a slight adjustment of language (dropping misfits in favor of vertex cover), the sequence of inequalities above also shows that the size of a minimum vertex cover in a bipartite graph equals the size of a maximum matching in the graph.</p>
<p>This was the relationship I’d promised to cover when we started, and it goes by Kőnig’s theorem in case you’d like to find out more — the argument we came up with here isn’t perhaps the traditional proof, and this is a fact that can be established in several different ways, all fun in their own way ❤️</p>

<p>Here’s a list of 50 things<sup>1</sup> (with occasional additional context) that I install whenever I’m setting up macOS from scratch.</p>
<div class="callout-note callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Bartender</p>
<p>Keeps the menubar clean. Very handy!</p></li>
<li><p>Better Touch Tool</p>
<p>I really need to leverage this a lot more, but even simple actions like swipe down with three fingers to close a tab, or tip-tap right left to move between tabs is pretty awesome already. Also use four-finger double tap to make the mouse pointer larger when it’s lost between screens… I’d guess this app can probably subsume a lot of the functionality offered by apps like Keyboard Maestro and Alfred.</p></li>
<li><p>iStat Menus</p>
<p>Good-looking stats in the menubar 👍️</p></li>
<li><p>Yoink</p>
<p>Has to be one of the best shelf apps out there. I know that there are a bunch of others in this space right now (👀, Filepane), however I have been using Yoink for so long that I haven’t considered switching. My common use-cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alfred actions to send-to-Yoink</li>
<li>Using Yoink to stash away screenshots before the floating image disappears</li>
<li>A KM shortcut that can send any Finder item to Yoink</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>CleanMyMac</p>
<p>Mostly to keep track of file sizes via the Space Lens, and running cleanups once in a while.</p>
<p>Alternative if using only this feature: Daisy Disk</p></li>
<li><p>Default Folder X</p>
<p>Use this all the time to stash away stuff where it belongs to keep Downloads clutter-free. Also the Alfred DFX collection is handy for finding recent items even if not 100% reliable.</p></li>
<li><p>Timing</p>
<p>Use this to supplement manual time-tracking. Do not use it to its full potential at all, I think a little investment with setting up the right projects etc. can go a long way.</p></li>
<li><p>Dropzone</p>
<p>I mostly use this as a longer-term stash than Yoink. I think there are some very nice possibilities here, but the only things I’ve done with it so far include:</p>
<ul>
<li>uploading images online</li>
<li>opening a finder path in a terminal (superseded by an Alfred shortcut)</li>
<li>dropping files in select locations</li>
<li>URL shortening</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Permute</p>
<p>Handy for all kinds of (bulk) file conversions.</p></li>
<li><p>Text Sniper</p>
<p>Impressive OCR “from anywhere”. The newer releases of macOS may make this redundant eventually though.</p></li>
<li><p>Swish</p>
<p>Intuitive gestures for window management. Pretty confident all this can be done in Better Touch Tool (above), but the actions are inspiring, and I’m lazy, so yeah, this is explicitly installed.</p></li>
<li><p>Downie</p>
<p>Use this for downloading videos from Youtube for offline viewing/listening. Fairly robust.</p></li>
<li><p>IconJar</p>
<p>Icon collection, enough said. 🎁</p></li>
<li><p>Sip</p>
<p>Handy 🎨 color picker.</p></li>
<li><p>World Clock Pro</p>
<p>Visually appealing world-clock, nice for scheduling stuff across timezones, great screensaver option as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Dash</p>
<p>Documentation lookup, handy that it works inside VS Code (via an extension).</p></li>
<li><p>MindNode</p>
<p>Lovely mindmaps.</p></li>
<li><p>PDFPen</p>
<p>Although I mostly use Preview, PDFPen is useful for quickly rearranging and removing pages. Not sure about the several other features claimed, I find that it sadly crashes more often than not, so not my default application.</p></li>
<li><p>TextSoap</p>
<p>Occasional use, but very useful when I do need it for some pesky hidden-unicode-character-removal exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>MathKey</p>
<p>Niche app - on the rare occasion that I have a complicated LaTeX formula to write, I can write it in the iOS version of this app and receive it on the Mac (I don’t think the desktop app is even necessary for this; the iOS purchase can be bypassed by using the Mac app via Sidecar, but this is where I discovered the app so it makes the list).</p></li>
<li><p>Marked</p>
<p>Powerful previews for Markdown documents. Lots of interesting export features.</p></li>
<li><p>ChronoSync Express</p>
<p>This helps with keeping certain folders in sync, and setting up some backup schedules. Nothing that can’t be done with a few scripts (?) and/or Time Machine, but I did end up setting (and forgetting) a few things in here.</p></li>

<li><p>Notion</p>
<p>I’m (admittedly* experimentally) using Notion as my primary PKM tool, and it’s also where I am keeping most of my public-facing content (including this blog). My usage of Notion is gradually expanding in scope to include time/task/finance tracking as well. Too slow.</p>
<p>*I’ve been in and out of Notion a few times by now, interleaved with fairly committed detours through Obsidian, Craft, and VSCode extensions for several months… I should mention that Craft is now available through Setapp, and that I am tentatively moving to Obsidian.</p></li>
<li><p>Bibdesk</p>
<p>Fairly robust reference management that has most of what I need — priority features include speed, reliability, flexibility in generating citekeys and decent auto-filing of papers added to the database (popular free and paid alternatives that I’ve tried briefly: Zotero, Mendeley, Setne, Papers, Readcube, JabRef, Bookends).</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you are into Obsidian and Zotero, you might enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGJH08ZfCs">this video</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>MacTeX</p>
<p>LaTeX and related tools, including TeX-friendly IDEs and reference management tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Xcode Tools, pandoc, and homebrew</p>
<p>Need these to work with code.</p></li>
<li><p>Contexts</p>
<p>The app that I miss the first when on a machine that doesn’t have it, next to Alfred. Makes window switching much more search and keyboard-driven.</p></li>
<li><p>Alfred</p>
<p>Apart from using it as a launcher (even for files), I almost use Alfred as a Finder replacement. Here are some of my favorite Alfred workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menubar Search</li>
<li>Simple Folder Search (only search for folders)</li>
<li>Case Switch (combined with send-text-to-Alfred below, this can be quite nifty)</li>
<li>Symbols Search (unicode goodness)</li>
<li>Send to Yoink</li>
<li>Quit Applications</li>
<li>Send text to Alfred (double-tap the option key)</li>
<li>Color</li>
<li>Currency Exchanges</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Keyboard Maestro</p>
<p>Really elaborate shortcut/automation app. I’ve only scratched the surface with my use cases, but one of the things I really dig about my setup is simulating keypress sequences.</p>
<p>The way I do this is to activate a macro group for one action with one keyboard shortcut (e.g, CMD + ;) and then have all macros within that have one-letter or one-letter + one-modifier triggers - basically <em>very easy triggers.</em> This way, I only have to remember a bunch of high-level shortcuts for things in various categories, and from there it’s just a letter (and the same letter can be overloaded in different contexts).</p>
<p>As a concrete example, I have a macro group called launchers, and a shortcut within that for launching chrome. So something like CMD+L followed by c would launch Chrome. Although I have to confess that I mostly launch stuff through Alfred still (at the cost of one or two extra keystrokes).</p>
<p>Keypress-sequence-triggers are native to Better Touch Tool and since BTT supports AppleScript, you could also run KM macros from BTT. I haven’t quite tried this yet.</p>
<p>More advice on this <a href="https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_use_a_multiple_keystroke_trigger">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Typinator</p>
<p>Fast snippet expansion - faster than TextExpander (one of the main competitors in this space) in my experience. Recent updates have some rad features, which of course I’m yet to explore and exploit!</p></li>
<li><p>1Password</p>
<p>Reasonably user-friendly and robust password management. Syncs to iOS, but I haven’t managed to leverage it so much on iOS. 1Password is ideal for storing confidential information nicely (IDs, bank stuff, and the like) - if used only for passwords I suppose the Keychain does a good job too.</p></li>
<li><p>Fantastical and Calendar</p>
<p>Fantastical is a nice (but expensive!) calendar app, mostly use it because of the calendar sets feature that keeps my <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2018/2/hyper-scheduling-mechanics">time blocking calendars</a> separate from the official one that is public within the organization. Of late, I especially like the way you can join online meetings from the notifications.</p>
<p><del>Having said that, I realized that much of what I was doing with Fantastical was overkill and I’ve switched to the default calendar app for now, and it’s one paid subscription less<sup>2</sup> to have.</del></p>
<p>Oh well: so I am back on Fantastical, I guess I really like the UI! Meanwhile, Busycal is a great alternative if you are on Setapp.</p></li>
<li><p>VS Code</p>
<p>This is where I am supposed to be spending most of my time, perhaps next only to Craft/Notion. A few things from my VSCode workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use different themes for different file types (I mostly dabble in LaTeX, C++, Python, JavaScript, and Markdown)</li>
<li>Little utility extensions save a lot of time: e.g, sort lines, increment value at cursor, file management, etc.</li>
<li>Multicursor-powered find and replace is amazing.</li>
<li>Workspaces are handy and I usually launch them from Alfred.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hook</p>
<p>Looks very promising for cross-linking stuff across apps that have a common context (say, a project). I really need to explore this more!</p>
<p>Update: Hook is now Hookmark, and is alo available through Setapp.</p></li>
<li><p>Stream Deck (best with accompanying hardware)</p>
<p>Particularly useful for switching OBS scenes although I use it less than I thought I would!</p>
<p>In particular, I want to explore their VSCode and KM integrations.</p>
<p>If without the physical device, Streamdeck does have a nice iOS app that simulates the hardware, but the pricing is based on a subscription model.</p></li>
<li><p>Google Chrome</p>
<p>I can’t make up my mind between Chrome/FF/Brave/Safari. I mostly switch between Chrome and Safari, with a mild preference for Chrome because of it’s more comprehensive extensions space, but I often end up with Safari as default for speed and privacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Readkit</p>
<p>Use this for RSS, although I’ve mostly migrated away to DEVONthink. Still looking for a nice stand-alone RSS reader though, Readkit doesn’t always render everything the way I expect, sadly.</p></li>
<li><p>OBS</p>
<p>For recording and live-streaming videos. Also useful as a virtual camera for meeting apps.</p></li>
<li><p>Screenflow and Camtasia</p>
<p>For recording videos, lots of features, still finding my way around them.</p></li>
<li><p>Slack and Discord</p>
<p>Online communities. I sometimes wish there was a native app for discourse too (is there?)</p></li>
<li><p>Keynote</p>
<p>Presentations - main alternative: Beamer + LaTeX + pgf/TikZ; or one of the JS-based slide generator tools from Markdown files (I did use react.js for one entire term).</p></li>
<li><p>DEVONthink</p>
<p>Use this fairly minimally (especially relative to the possibilities). At the moment DT indexes a couple of key finder folders and pulls in information from a lot of RSS feeds and even Twitter accounts. I try to review the stuff that automatically piles up in DT regularly, but — at the moment — it’s mostly a dumping ground and… messy.</p></li>
<li><p>Microsoft Teams, Skype, and Zoom</p>
<p>Use this for classes and online meetings.</p></li>
<li><p>Office suite: Word/Powerpoint/Excel</p>
<p>Use it only to open files I receive.</p></li>
<li><p>Fruitjuice</p>
<p>Useful battery health monitoring, discovered the app from a MPU podcast episode IIRC.</p></li>
<li><p>Mathsnip</p>
<p>Surprisingly good LaTeX-aware OCR.</p></li>

<p>You can find the original announcement <a href="../2021/">here</a> and more specifics clarifying the format (or the lack of it) <a href="../about/">here</a>. Here’s the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put up a piece of content everyday between 27th September and 30th October, with the possibility of skipping one day per week;</li>
<li>Post a link to your content on Twitter with #exportober</li>
<li>That’s it, actually. 🤷‍♀️</li>

<p>Psst. It’s quite fine to sign up even if you’re reading this after the 27th of September. The automated tracking exercise here will stop after the 30th of October, so you can be a part of this by just contributing in this window. It certainly does’t <em>have</em> to be daily and it doesn’t <em>have</em> to be 30 things, although I found those to be useful default targets to work with for myself.</p>
</section>
<section id="sign-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sign-up">Sign up!</h2>
<p><del>While you can participate simply by using #exportober in your tweets, it’ll be great if you could explicitly enter your Twitter username in the form below, so we can check in on each other!</del> 🤝</p>
<p>While I’m not going to write a Twitter bot that will send you daily reminders over DM, I do hope to create a separate page for each registered participant at the end of the challenge that shows off just their entries in one place, so it’s helpful to know who you are 😀</p>

<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<p>In a massively impulsive move nudged by some Twitter feedback, I recently launched <a href="../2021/">the Exportober challenge</a>.</p>
<p>The TL;DR version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put up a <strong>piece of content</strong>* everyday between 27th September and 30th October, with the possibility of skipping one day per week;</li>
<li>Post a link to your content on Twitter with #exportober</li>
<li>That’s it, actually. 🤷‍♀️</li>

<p>I was deliberately vague about the terms-and-conditions that goes with the piece of content piece above. The rules I mentioned were minimal: since there are no restrictions of age, keep the content SFW and generally legal. Other than that, anything goes, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I doodle? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I meme? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I make a comic? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I quip? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I tweet a thread? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I tweet a single tweet? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I song and/or hum and/or dance? Yes.</li>
<li>Can I react? I am unfamiliar with this genre, but yeah, why not?</li>
<li>Can I just quote? Uhh, ok-fine, sure — maybe be sure to include a reaction?</li>
<li>Can I commit? Yes, please! Oh, you mean — can it be a GitHub commit? Right, yeah, sure.</li>

<p>As you can see, there are no restrictions on format or length or quality. It can be whatever you want, and however long or short you want it to be. The point is to <em>get into the habit</em> of putting a bit of yourself into something tangible that you’d want to share.</p>
<p>So while you could technically schedule thirty pieces of Harry Potter trivia in advance — <em>that</em> would kind of defeat the purpose.</p>

<p>In general, I imagine only you would know if this is for you — this may not be a priority or a point of interest for you right now, but if you’re reading this, possibly your interest is at least mildly piqued?</p>
<p>What this is about is setting aside some time for yourself and to participate alongside friends who’re in it for fun and profit:</p>

We often avoid taking action because we think "I need to learn more," but the best way to learn is often by taking action.

<ul>
<li>The fun bit is in the making and sharing.</li>
<li>The profit bit is the hope that we trick ourselves into making this a bit of a regular habit for life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer term, you may or may not want to be sharing or publishing on a daily basis. But hopefully, longer term, <strong>you are engaged with the process on a regular basis</strong>.</p>
<p>Personally, there’s almost nothing that I do consistently on a daily basis, not counting the things one needs to do continue being alive. I’d like to see if I can change that a bit<sup>1</sup>, and apparently doing such things bit by bit — and with some public commitment — <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">is a good idea</a>, hence the micro-nature of the challenge.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote" data-conversation="none">

So overall I’ve gotten to a point where I’m just afraid to even think about putting something together because I think it’s an unrealistic commitment of time. <br><br>I’m also really bad at chunking - everything I do of this sort manifests at the wrong end of an all-nighter 🙈

<p>Hmm. One way that you could still make this work for you is to build out your masterpiece bit by bit. If it’s a tutorial, you could plan it out in advance and work through one coherent section a day. If it’s a sketch, you could share your partial progress as you go along, and even put it together in a timelapse at the end? That would be great to see!</p>
<p>There are some types of long-form content that aren’t naturally amenable to this type of chunking; say you want to put together a video exposition, make an origami sculpture, or crochet a Klein bottle. In this situation, you could either use the challenge to document your process and progress; or you could just claim to engage in #exportoberlite with a reduced frequency of production — say once a week, or one masterpiece at the end — you’ll just have to still tweet it out so I can catalog it ❤️</p>

I really don’t like the illusion that there is one process for making and that it involves writing every day. Thinking is work to. So is reading. So is doing things that seem unrelated to writing. Our brains are always thinking about what we’re making, whether we’re typing or not

<p>Also, while on the subject of masterpieces, there’s the <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/">parable of the pots</a>. On the other hand, everyone does have their own process, and the idea isn’t to force a format: this process is temporary, flexible, and optional 🙌</p>

<p>Oooh. Maybe just ping on Twitter if you are in this situation. I do imagine that there are folks who have more ideas than they can handle, so if you have the bandwidth, it’ll even out nicely! For some starter inspiration, just in case it is useful, here are some of the post types that I’m planning for the duration of this challenge, in roughly increasing order of desperation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Trying some of the <a href="https://www.tifr.res.in/~outreach/chai_and_why.html">Chai and Why? experiments</a> and documenting <del>any accidents</del> learnings.</li>
<li>Puzzles and programming contest roundups.</li>
<li>Lecture notes for classes/talks I’m teaching and/or attending.</li>
<li>Highlights from whatever podcasts I’m tuned into.</li>
<li>Clean up draft essays from previous lives.</li>
<li>Random doodles. And VSCode keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>Hot takes on inconsequential debates.<sup>2</sup></li>
</ol>
<p>I also have a few black holes nurtured over time — I’m looking at you, all my Read-It-<del>Never</del>Later apps, the starred section in my RSS app, my YouTube watchlist, and relatives. Maybe about time to go down some of these rabbit holes with the excuse of commentary to follow.</p>
<p>So yes, that’ll be all for now! Let’s see how this goes 🤞 Meanwhile, <a href="../2021/">please hop on</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neeldhara/status/1439668714178105347">spread the word</a> for all of us? Thank you! 🎉</p>
<hr>
<p>PS. You might be curious about what participating will <em>look like</em>. I’m trying to setup a separate page for each participant in the challenge that will pull in all your tagged tweets. I’ll share a preview soon!</p>
