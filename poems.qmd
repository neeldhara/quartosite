This page collects a small number of attempts at what I thought was poetry at the time I wrote it. This was done when I was even more of a kid than I am now. You can subscribe to a feed for this series by [clicking here](poems.xml), although I don't expect to add much :)

I put these up thanks to being in a ~~foolish~~ inspired mood, having read [_How to Write One Song_](https://www.amazon.in/How-Write-One-Song-Loving/dp/0593183525) (c.f a [related podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS84MkZJMzVQeA/episode/YzI0NWMyNzktZWMyYy00ZWM3LWE5ZWMtMjU0MGE0MjJmNTc5?hl=en-IN&ved=2ahUKEwjB35W1lfz5AhVnSmwGHd9TCXIQjrkEegQICBAF&ep=6)).
